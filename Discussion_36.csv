6,6220807,2018,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","Comparative effectiveness of canagliflozin, SGLT2 inhibitors and non‐SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and amputation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A real‐world meta‐analysis of 4 observational databases (OBSERVE‐4D)","OBSERVE‐4D is a retrospective observational study representing the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of the comparative effects of canagliflozin and other SGLT2i to date. By comparing the real‐world experience of more than 140 000 patients initiating canagliflozin with that of more than 100 000 new users of empagliflozin or dapagliflozin and more than 460 000 new users of non‐SGLT2i, we can further characterize the potential benefits and harms of SGLT2i as observed in routine clinical practice, to complement evidence generated by randomized trials and prior observational studies. The use of 4 different administrative claims databases representing multiple segments of the US health care system, including privately‐insured populations, patients supported through state Medicaid programmes and patients qualifying for national Medicare coverage, and the consistency of results across these databases provide reassurance concerning the generalizability of these real‐world findings. 

To our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis providing direct head‐to‐head comparative evidence for HHF or BKLE amputation among individual drugs within the SGLT2i class. The analyses revealed a consistent pattern that suggests a class effect of SGLT2i that reduces the risk of HHF relative to non‐SGLT2i, both overall and within the subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease. Compared with new users of a DPP‐4i or GLP‐1 receptor agonist, new users of canagliflozin had a lower risk of HHF in the on‐treatment and intent‐to‐treat analyses; the magnitude of the effect was similar to that observed when comparing new users of empagliflozin or dapagliflozin and new users of non‐SGLT2i. No difference in HHF was observed in the head‐to‐head comparison of canagliflozin and other SGLT2i within any database, subgroup or time‐at‐risk period. 

Neither canagliflozin nor the other SGLT2i showed a consistent increased risk of BKLE amputation relative to non‐SGLT2i in either the overall population or within the subpopulation of patients with established cardiovascular disease, although none of the analyses was sufficiently powered to rule out the possibility of a modest effect. This study also provided the first real‐world comparison of the risk of BKLE amputation with the use of canagliflozin relative to the use of other SGLT2i, and found no statistically or clinically significant differences in any database in either the on‐treatment or intent‐to‐treat analyses. 

HHF findings from this study are consistent with those from the CANVAS Program and EASEL study for canagliflozin, from the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME study for empagliflozin and from the CVD‐REAL analysis of SGLT2i more broadly.1, 3, 5, 8 Thus, the HHF result is a positive confirmatory finding; the consistency with clinical trial results supports the internal validity and gives us a level of confidence that a positive association could be successfully identified if present. Empirical calibration using 44 negative control outcomes provides support that our study design was unlikely to yield spurious associations with false positive findings as the result of systematic or random error. It is noteworthy that, in this study, the decreased risk of HHF was consistent among all new users, as well as within the subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease, even in light of the substantial increase in baseline risk for patients with established cardiovascular disease. It is also noteworthy that the effect estimates showed little heterogeneity across databases, and were robust in a wide array of sensitivity analyses. As expected and observed elsewhere, the magnitude of the effect is smaller in the intent‐to‐treat analyses than in the on‐treatment analyses, but it is nonetheless encouraging to see the decrease in risk of HHF persist for some period, even after treatment discontinuation or switching. 

The comparative safety results for amputation are less concordant with prior studies and warrant further scrutiny. An increased risk of BKLE amputation with the use of canagliflozin was identified during the CANVAS Program, which included patients with established cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk.1 In the CANVAS Program, the increased risk of amputation began to emerge after 6 to 12 months of exposure.1 Increased risk of BKLE amputation was not observed in any other studies across the phase 3/4 canagliflozin development programme, although there was limited power to evaluate risk in this population.7 In the CANVAS Program, the incidence rates for amputation were 6.3 and 3.4 participants per 1000 patient‐years with canagliflozin and placebo, respectively, over a median follow‐up period of 126 weeks, and the HR (95% CI) was 1.97 (1.41‐2.75).1 Despite differences in the observed HRs, the CIs for the CANVAS Program and this study overlap. Compared with the CANVAS Program, this study had a lower event rate (1‐5 events per 1000 person‐years, on‐treatment and in the overall population) and a shorter follow‐up time (median, 60‐100 days on‐treatment). Therefore, the current study had limited statistical power to detect differences in the 6 to 12‐month period, the time at which amputation risk began to emerge in the CANVAS Program, particularly in patients with established cardiovascular disease. This discrepancy may be a limitation, as a constant risk assumption may be violated and the potential effect may require additional observation time before being detectable in a manner that is in line with the trial. On the other hand, it may be revealing that real‐world utilization of these drugs suggests that the continuous exposure periods observed in clinical practice are often shorter than the point at which the purported risk may take effect. It is also possible that differences in the risk of BKLE amputation could be attributable to the composition of the patient population, as patients who opt to participate in clinical trials may not always reflect the general population. When attempting to reconcile these results with those of the EASEL study, it is worth highlighting that the EASEL population was older than that of CCAE, Optum and MDCD, and the EASEL study had a slightly longer median follow‐up time.8 Also, between the 2 cohorts, the EASEL study included only 17 events in the on‐treatment analysis and 35 events in the intent‐to‐treat analysis in the SGLT2i cohort,8 whereas this study included 33 on‐treatment and 163 intent‐to‐treat events among the cohort of new users of canagliflozin with established cardiovascular disease across the 4 databases. Relative to the EASEL study, this analysis also conducted a larger array of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings. 

This study is subject to the limitations typical of observational database research, including the potential for unmeasured confounding and misclassification error that could bias the findings; however, the use of negative controls suggests little to no systematic error. Because the results were largely consistent across 4 databases, any such source of systematic error could be attributable to artifacts associated with the administrative claims process or consistent provider channeling behaviour that would persist independent of insurance coverage. No source record validation was performed to validate exposures, outcomes or baseline covariates, and it is possible that differential bias may have affected these attributes. 

In this large observational study, treatment with canagliflozin was associated with lower risk of HHF than non‐SGLT2i, and the risk of HHF with canagliflozin was comparable to that with other SGLT2i. There were no observed differences in risk of BKLE amputation among canagliflozin, other SGLT2i or all non‐SGLT2i, in either the overall population or the subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease. Overall, these results suggest that canagliflozin has a profile similar to other SGLT2i as used in routine clinical practice. Patients and providers may find this information useful when weighing the comparative benefits against the potential risks in making treatment decisions to support diabetes care."
7,6174555,2018,Cardiovascular diabetology,Impact of dapagliflozin on left ventricular diastolic function of patients with type 2 diabetic mellitus with chronic heart failure,"The findings of our study indicate that LV diastolic function as assessed by E/e′ for T2DM patients with stable HF had significantly improved 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin. Other LV diastolic functional parameters such as LAVI and LVMI also improved 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin. In addition, BNP significantly decreased in T2DM patients with BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL. 

Characteristics of HF in T2DM 
Heart failure can be defined as a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. Its prevalence increases with age and involves comorbidities such as hypertension, overweight/obesity, and T2DM. Structural cardiac changes seen in T2DM include increased interstitial fibrosis, increased LV wall thickness, and often increased LV mass [15], alterations which contribute to, but are not a prerequisite to, the development of functional myocardial impairments. As a consequence, LV diastolic dysfunction is the classical and most frequently observed early LV functional abnormality in T2DM patients [16], and asymptomatic LV diastolic dysfunction has been detected in up to 75% of normotensive DM patients without evident coronary artery disease [17]. The myocardial dysfunction in T2DM usually is progressive with an early asymptomatic phase where the heart hypertrophies, leading to LV diastolic dysfunction when LVEF has been preserved [18]. This is followed by a late stage, which is characterized by alteration in microvasculature compliance, an increase in LV size, and a decrease in cardiac performance leading to symptomatic HF. Predictors for progression to the late stage, which may take several years, include comorbidities often seen in T2DM such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, overweight/obesity, and microvascular changes [19]. 

Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on LV diastolic functional parameters 
LV diastolic dysfunction is thought to be the underlying pathophysiological abnormality of patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF in particular, and thus its assessment plays an important role in diagnosis. In addition, it has been reported that LV diastolic dysfunction is independently associated with outcomes in patients with HFrEF as well as HFpEF or HFmrEF [9, 10]. SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with lower blood pressure and weight loss as well as a reduction in HbA1c levels, changes which in turn have a significant impact on LV function, so that SGLT2 inhibitors may ultimately have a potential beneficial effect on LV diastolic function in patients with T2DM. In addition, it has recently reported that SGLT2 inhibitors have a multifaceted effect on cardiac function including improvement in endothelial dysfunction and aortic stiffness [20], reduction in epicardial fat accumulation [21] as well as in visceral adipocyte hypertrophy [22]. Such effects may well lead to improvement in LV diastolic function. Verma et al. reported on the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin (10 mg/day) 3 months after its initiation in terms of objective measurements of cardiac structure and function observed in 10 patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease. This short-term empagliflozin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in LVMI and improved LV diastolic function as assessed in terms of e′ [23]. More recently, Matsutani et al. performed a prospective single-center pilot study to evaluate the effects of canagliflozin on LV diastolic function in 37 T2DM patients with preserved LVEF [24]. They also found that LV diastolic function as assessed in terms of E/e′ and LVMI had significantly improved 3 months after the initiation of canagliflozin. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis showed that changes in HbA1c were an independent predictive factor for changes in E/e′. In line with previous studies involving T2DM patients without HF, our prospective multicenter trial using T2DM patients with HF showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with improvements in LV diastolic functional parameters including E/e′, LAVI, and LVMI. Although the precise mechanism of the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on LV diastolic function remains uncertain, the increased diuresis with reduced pre-load by means of SGLT2 inhibitors may play an important role. The average E/e′ at baseline in this study was relatively low because all patients were in stable HF condition. Since significant correlation was observed between E/e′ and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in HF patients [25, 26], we believed that decreased E/e′ even in patients with normal range of E/e′ would be beneficial. In addition, BNP significantly decreased in T2DM patients with BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL in our study, so that SGLT2 inhibitors may have the potential to result in LV unloading in case of HF patients with an LV load at a certain level. 

Clinical implication 
As mentioned earlier, the pathogenesis of DM-related cardiac dysfunction is thought to be multifactorial, and possibly a key factor for the development of HFpEF in T2DM patients, which presents as LV diastolic dysfunction. Moreover, LV diastolic function plays an important role for patients with HFrEF and HFmrEF as well as HFpEF in the development of cardiovascular events and outcomes. HFrEF has evolved into a distinct therapeutic entity partly because large outcome trials demonstrated the efficacy of neurohumoral inhibition, but no similar evolution has occurred in the case of HFpEF, because large trials testing neurohumoral inhibition consistently failed to attain a positive primary outcome [27–29]. In trials testing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β-blockers, or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, a modest positive trend was sometimes observed but only for secondary outcomes or retrospectively defined sub-groups [29–31]. Currently, therefore, there is no effective treatment for LV diastolic dysfunction to improve outcomes for HF patients. Our study, however, showed that LV diastolic functional parameters including E/e′, LAVI and LVMI for T2DM patients with stable HF had significantly improved 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin. Thus, our findings may well have clinical implications for better management of T2DM patients with HF. 

Study limitations 
This study covered a relatively small number of patients without placebo-controlled group, so that further prospective studies with larger patient populations including placebo-controlled group will be needed to validate our findings. According to previous studies, SGLT2 inhibitors have the potential to result in lower blood pressure and weight loss for T2DM patients, in addition to reducing their HbA1c levels. Body weight significantly improved 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin, while HbA1c and blood pressure tended to decrease, but without statistical significance. The exact reason why SGLT2 inhibitors led to minor improvements in HbA1c and blood pressure remains unclear, but the heterogeneity of the study population of different HF classifications or small number of patients may be related to this finding. Furthermore, Habibi et al. showed that the treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin) improved LV diastolic function in obese female mice with diabetes, even in the absence of a reduction in blood pressure and HbA1c [32]. They also showed that the improvement in LV diastolic function was associated, not only with improved glycemia and blood pressure, but with improvements in cardiac structure, including reductions in interstitial myocardial fibrosis and associated pro-fibrotic SGK1/ENaC protein expression levels, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte mitochondrial ultrastructure."
13,4850750,2016,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Dapagliflozin reduces albuminuria in patients with diabetes and hypertension receiving renin‐angiotensin blockers,"This post hoc analysis studied the effects of dapagliflozin as an adjunct to ACE inhibitors and ARBs on renal variables in patients with T2DM and microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. Treatment with dapagliflozin reduced albuminuria compared with placebo and caused an initial fall in eGFR that was completely reversible 1 week after study drug discontinuation. The albuminuria‐lowering effect of dapagliflozin was to a large extent independent of the HbA1c‐, SBP‐, body weight‐ and eGFR‐lowering effects, suggesting that other mechanisms are also involved in the albuminuria‐lowering effect of dapagliflozin. These results also suggest that SGLT2 inhibition with dapagliflozin may confer renoprotective effects. 

An initial fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been previously shown after administration of dapagliflozin 20. In the present study, however, we showed that the initial fall in eGFR was completely reversible only 1 week after dapagliflozin discontinuation. This reversibility indicates that the initial fall in eGFR did not reflect a reduction in the number of functioning nephrons but a haemodynamic‐induced reduction in single nephron GFR. Indeed, SGLT2 inhibition increases sodium delivery to the macula densa. The increased sodium delivery is sensed as an increase in circulating volume at the level of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, leading to a constriction of afferent renal arterioles, a reduction in intraglomerular pressure and a reversible reduction in single nephron GFR 10, 21. This reversible fall in eGFR is similar to that observed with ACE inhibitors and ARBs; however, the underlying mechanism is different from that of SGLT2 inhibitors, as ACE inhibitors and ARBs cause a vasodilatory efferent response, thereby decreasing intraglomerular pressure. Various studies have shown that a reduction in intraglomerular pressure is associated with long‐term renal preservation 22, 23, 24, suggesting that the reversible fall in eGFR with dapagliflozin is an indicator of its potential long‐term renal protective potency. 

Dapagliflozin also significantly decreased albuminuria. This finding is consistent with other studies showing that SGLT2 inhibitors decrease albuminuria 25, 26. In patients with T2DM and chronic kidney disease (CKD), canagliflozin 100 mg/day and empagliflozin 25 mg/day decreased albuminuria by ∼22 and 35% relative to placebo, respectively 25, 26. A principal finding of the present study is that the albuminuria‐lowering effect of dapagliflozin is to a large extent independent of changes in eGFR, SBP, body weight or HbA1c. Apparently, other effects of dapagliflozin account for the albuminuria‐lowering properties, although we cannot exclude residual confounding caused by measurement variability. Continuous glucose excretion and the resulting metabolic effects not measured in this study may be one explanation for the potential renoprotective effects. Additionally, experimental studies have suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors exert intrarenal anti‐inflammatory effects that may be mediated by inhibition of glucose entry into tubular cells 13, 27. Anti‐inflammatory interventions have indeed been linked with albuminuria reduction 28. Unfortunately, inflammatory biomarkers were not measured in this study, and it is therefore not possible to verify this possibility. 

The finding that the albuminuria‐lowering effect of dapagliflozin was independent of changes in HbA1c or SBP suggests a dissociation of the albuminuria response from responses in HbA1c or SBP. This uncoupling of responses in multiple characteristics of a single drug has also been observed with other drugs including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors and endothelin receptor antagonists 29, 30, 31. The underlying mechanisms of this uncoupling in response are unknown and require further study. 

In the placebo arm, albuminuria decreased by nearly 20%, which is a larger placebo effect compared with other clinical trials 28, 32, 33. The reduction in albuminuria in the placebo arm probably reflects a regression to the mean phenomenon, as we selected only patients with UACR ≥30 mg/g based on the value from a single visit; therefore, it is particularly important to interpret the albuminuria reduction with dapagliflozin in the context of the placebo effect. Nevertheless, this still resulted in a reduction of >30% after 12 weeks of treatment. The placebo‐corrected reduction in albuminuria in the dapagliflozin arm would translate into a 30% relative risk reduction in end‐stage renal disease, assuming no changes in other renal risk markers 34. 

As SGLT2 inhibition has been shown to increase urinary glucose excretion and reduce eGFR, there have been concerns around renal safety. There have also been concerns of unfavourable volume loss attributable to the diuretic action. In the present analysis in patients with albuminuria and a renal function mainly within CKD stage 1 and 2 categories, there were numerically more laboratory‐associated AEs related to renal function with dapagliflozin than with placebo, mainly as a result of increases in blood creatinine. This was an expected finding, given dapagliflozin's mode of action. Importantly, none of these events was classified as serious by the investigators. There was also no increase in the proportion of patients with more pronounced creatinine increases (≥1.5× baseline values) as compared with placebo. The proportion of patients with a marked increase in serum potassium was also similar to placebo. Although there were more patients with potentially volume‐related AEs as compared with placebo, none of these AEs was classified as serious. As observed in previous studies, more patients receiving dapagliflozin experienced a urinary tract infection, although the total number was low. Overall, this post hoc analysis indicated a beneficial renal profile in the studied CKD categories. 

The present study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration. First, this was a post hoc analysis of two randomized controlled trials, and the original studies were not designed to assess the effect of dapagliflozin on renal variables. The results can therefore only be interpreted as hypothesis‐generating. The study did not include an active comparator to prospectively determine whether the albuminuria‐lowering effects were independent of glucose or blood pressure control. A study design with two additional treatment arms including a sulphonylurea derivative to control HbA1c and hydrochlorothiazide to control blood pressure could add to the interpretation. UACR was measured in a single spot urine sample. It is known that the day‐to‐day variability in spot urine samples is larger than first morning void samples. The use of single spot urine samples in the present study may have resulted in a lower precision (larger standard error) of the treatment effect compared with when first morning void samples were used; however, despite the use of single spot urine samples, a clear and highly significant treatment effect could still be detected. Finally, renal blood flow and filtration fraction were not measured to determine with ‘gold‐standard’ techniques the effect of dapagliflozin on intraglomerular pressure. The lack of measured GFR and use of eGFR, which is less accurate, may explain why the effect of dapagliflozin on albuminuria was not mediated by changes in GFR. 

In conclusion, reductions in albuminuria in patients with T2DM and hypertension using renin‐angiotensin system blockade therapy were larger in dapagliflozin‐treated patients compared with placebo‐treated patients. The reduction in albuminuria appeared to be in large part independent of changes in HbA1c, SBP, body weight or eGFR. The safety profile of dapagliflozin in the present study was consistent with other dapagliflozin studies and no increase in the occurrence of serious renal AEs was observed. Improved glycaemic control and reductions in SBP and body weight with dapagliflozin treatment, in addition to beneficial renal effects, may alter the course of progressive diabetic kidney disease and warrant further study."
15,5836959,2018,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A pooled analysis of safety data from phase IIb/III clinical trials,"This pooled analysis reports the safety findings for dapagliflozin, including the newer emergent safety issues of ketoacidosis and lower limb amputation, thereby adding to the knowledge of the safety of this agent in patients with T2DM. This analysis identified no new safety signals for dapagliflozin.

The risk of hypoglycaemia associated with SGLT2 inhibitors is low, as suggested by their mechanism of action and clinical experience to date, and a similar incidence of hypoglycaemia was observed between dapagliflozin and placebo in the analysis reported here. In a pooled analysis of empagliflozin trials, 23.1%, 22.7% and 22.7% of patients receiving empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg and placebo, respectively, reported AEs of hypoglycaemia.12 In a pooled analysis of canagliflozin trials, AEs of hypoglycaemia were reported for 6.9%, 4.1% and 2.9% of patients receiving canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg, and placebo, respectively, as monotherapy, and for 44.4%, 49.4%, and 34.0% of patients, respectively, who were also receiving background antihyperglycaemic drugs.14

Renal function AEs were observed with dapagliflozin in the present analysis. AEs consistent with decreased renal function have also been shown with other SGLT2 inhibitors (1.8, 1.8 and 2.2 per 100 patient‐years with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg and placebo, respectively [events consistent with decreased renal function, based on narrow standardised MedDRA queries acute renal failure],13 and 2.1, 2.5 and 2.6 per 100 patient‐years with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and control,14 respectively). It is worth noting that there are differences in the clinical trial programmes for each SGLT2 inhibitor regarding the definition of AEs of renal function, the requirements for laboratory testing, and the criteria for discontinuation and reporting of AEs based on laboratory values.

The AEs of renal function observed with dapagliflozin were primarily associated with transient changes in serum creatinine or renal creatinine clearance, and were rarely associated with SAEs of renal failure or marked abnormalities of serum creatinine >2.5 g/dL (data not shown). Notably, some of the dapagliflozin studies had protocol‐specific discontinuation requirements for patients with confirmed calculated creatinine clearance that decreased below a specific level (this level varied across studies) and/or increases in serum creatinine. The AEs of renal function were recorded cumulatively over the 24‐week treatment period; it can be speculated that the initial decline in eGFR may have been recorded as an AE although eGFR levels returned towards baseline over time. The early, transient changes were not indicative of progressive renal dysfunction, however, as demonstrated by the gradual increase towards baseline in eGFR over time. It has been postulated that the transient decreases in eGFR relate to the haemodynamic changes resulting from diuresis and a reduction in blood pressure.20 Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibition restricts proximal tubular reabsorption of glucose and sodium, leading to increased sodium delivery to the macula densa that alters tubuloglomerular feedback causing renal glomerular afferent vasoconstriction. This may have also contributed to the initial decline in eGFR, which subsequently returns to baseline once the initial transient natriuresis observed with dapagliflozin resolved.21, 22

In our pooled analysis, eGFR did not return to baseline in the overall population treated with dapagliflozin, possibly because of the relatively short duration of treatment; however, in longer‐term dapagliflozin studies, the initial decline in eGFR was observed to return to near‐ or above‐baseline levels by week 24 that remained stable to week 102.23 This finding correlates with the findings noted in the empagliflozin and canagliflozin trials. In the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial, a short‐term eGFR decrease followed by stabilization over time was observed for empagliflozin (median treatment duration 2.6 years, median observation time 3.1 years).24 Likewise, an initial decrease in eGFR (∼3‐6 weeks) that attenuated over time has also been observed for canagliflozin.25

Osmotic diuresis caused by SGLT2 inhibition may potentially lead to volume depletion in susceptible patients; however, the incidence of volume depletion was low in our analysis and analyses of the currently marketed SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated that the risk of these events lessens over time.14, 26 The incidence of events of volume depletion was observed to be low with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg and placebo (1.8, 1.9 and 1.7 per 100 patient‐years, respectively), with an increased incidence of events observed in patients aged ≥75 years (3.2, 3.0 and 2.3 per 100 patient‐years, respectively) and those receiving loop diuretics (5.0, 4.4 and 3.5 per 100 patient‐years, respectively).13 The incidence of events of volume depletion over 104 weeks was 2.9%, 3.6% and 2.1% with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and control, respectively.14 In the CANVAS trial, the incidence of events of volume depletion was 26.0 vs 18.5 per 1000 patient‐years with canagliflozin vs placebo, respectively.1 While volume depletion was low with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, there is need for caution when prescribing an SGLT2 inhibitor to the elderly and those receiving loop diuretics.

Clinical trials show that SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of genital infections; however, clinical data on the associated risk of UTIs are less consistent. In our analysis, no increase in the risk of UTIs was observed with dapagliflozin vs placebo. The proportions of patients reporting UTIs were 15.1%, 14.5% and 15.0% with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg and placebo, respectively.13 The incidence rates of UTIs were 7.7, 6.8 and 6.4 per 100 patient‐years with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and placebo, respectively.14

The incidence of genital infection was higher with dapagliflozin vs control in the present analysis, and this is consistent with other analyses of dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin.2, 12, 13, 14, 19, 27 A meta‐analysis comparing all SGLT2 inhibitors with placebo observed a 4 to 6 times increased risk of genital infection with SGLT2 inhibitor use.28

There is an increased risk of fracture in patients with T2DM, and some anti‐hyperglycaemic therapies (eg, thiazolidinediones) may further exacerbate this.29 SGLT2 inhibition has the potential to increase serum phosphate levels, which has been hypothesized to exert adverse effects on bone30; however, in this pooled analysis, dapagliflozin did not increase fracture risk vs control. Furthermore, no clinically meaningful changes in bone minerals including calcium, inorganic phosphorus and 25‐hydroxyvitamin D have been reported with dapagliflozin vs placebo.31

No increased incidence of fracture was observed in pooled analyses comparing empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg and placebo (2.8, 2.5 and 2.9 per 100 patient‐years, respectively)13 or canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and control (1.2, 1.4 and 1.1 per 100 patient‐years, respectively)14; however, the FDA has previously strengthened the drug safety warnings for canagliflozin relating to fracture owing to a higher incidence of fracture observed with canagliflozin vs placebo in an interim analysis of the CANVAS trial.18 This was confirmed by the final analysis of the CANVAS trial in patients with a history of CV disease or at high CV risk, which showed higher fracture rates with canagliflozin vs placebo (16.9 vs 10.9 per 1000 patient‐years; hazard ratio 1.55; 95% CI 1.21‐1.97)1; however, the CANVAS‐R (CANVAS‐Renal) trial in patients with a history of CV disease or at high CV risk1 and other canagliflozin studies that enrolled a general diabetes population have not shown any differences in fracture risk with canagliflozin vs control.32

Small mean changes in lipid variables were observed in the present analysis; however, these changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful. Likewise, small changes in lipids were noted in the pooled analysis of empagliflozin trials.13 Canagliflozin showed increases in LDL cholesterol, non‐HDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol compared with control14; however, CV safety of canagliflozin has been confirmed in the recent CV outcomes trial (CANVAS) in patients with T2DM and high CV risk.1

Post‐marketing reports of SGLT2 inhibitor‐associated ketoacidosis33 resulted in the FDA issuing a safety communication concerning euglycaemic ketoacidosis in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology subsequently released a position statement34 that highlighted the need to fully understand the mechanisms of the metabolic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors, with a focus on analysing the potential problem of DKA with lower‐than‐anticipated glucose levels.

In the present analysis, there was only 1 reported SAE of DKA. It may have occurred in response to insulin dose reduction, which is considered as a precipitant of DKA.34 In a pooled analysis of empagliflozin studies (n = 12 620), incidence rates of DKA were 0.1 (n = 5), <0.1 (n = 1) and 0.1 (n = 5) per 100 patient‐years with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg and placebo, respectively.13 In clinical trials of canagliflozin (n = 17 596), incidence rates of DKA and related events were 0.52 (n = 4), 0.76 (n = 6), and 0.24 (n = 2) per 1000 patient‐years with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and comparator, respectively.34 The majority of canagliflozin‐treated patients reporting serious DKA had associated precipitating factors such as non‐compliance with insulin therapy, and 6 of the 10 canagliflozin‐treated patients indicated evidence of autoimmune diabetes (ie, type 1 diabetes, etc.).35

A low frequency of amputation was observed in dapagliflozin‐ and placebo‐/active comparator‐treated patients; however, the number of patients with amputation events was too low to draw any conclusions based on the differences observed in baseline characteristics. Although drug safety communications have been issued regarding amputations observed with canagliflozin in the CANVAS trial1; possible mechanisms are unclear.

Bladder cancer is another safety issue that has been previously explored, owing to a numerical imbalance observed between dapagliflozin‐ and control‐treated patients in the new drug application submitted to the US FDA in 2011.36 In an updated analysis of >9000 patients in the phase IIb/III dapagliflozin trials, 9/5936 and 1/3403 dapagliflozin‐ and comparator‐treated patients, respectively, reported bladder cancer, with an incident rate ratio of 5.168 (95% CI 0.68‐233.55).37 The totality of the data, with a small number of bladder cancer cases and the lack of carcinogenic potential of dapagliflozin in preclinical studies, does not support a causal relationship between dapagliflozin and increased bladder cancer risk. There was however, the possibility of ascertainment bias possibly because of a thorough investigation of microhaematuria from the time of randomization. Bladder cancer is being further assessed in a post‐authorization safety study and the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 (NCT01730534) trial.

This pooled analysis included treatment‐naïve patients and those receiving multiple background therapies including insulin. All analyses included data after the initiation of rescue therapy. It is possible that background therapies may have contributed to the incidence of some AEs, in particular hypoglycaemia. Another limitation was that the data were collected from clinical trials and because real‐world patients do not always fit the profile of those included in clinical trials, findings from this analysis should be applied to the real world with caution.

In conclusion, overall, the proportion of patients experiencing AEs, including hypoglycaemia, volume depletion, UTI and fracture, was generally balanced in the dapagliflozin and placebo/active comparator treatment groups. AEs of renal function with dapagliflozin were related to transient changes in renal laboratory values. Genital infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin vs placebo, and this finding is consistent with the previously reported data for SGLT2 inhibitors. A very low frequency of lower limb amputations was observed in the patients in the dapagliflozin and control groups. AEs of DKA, ketonuria or metabolic acidosis were rare, with 1 event of DKA reported in the dapagliflozin group. No new safety signals for dapagliflozin were identified in this pooled analysis of a large number of patients."
16,6450503,2019,Upsala journal of medical sciences,"Effects of DAPAgliflozin on CARDiac substrate uptake, myocardial efficiency, and myocardial contractile work in type 2 diabetes patients—a description of the DAPACARD study","The beneficial effects of the SGLT2 inhibitors on CV outcomes, including CV mortality and decreased rate of heart failure admissions, is a major progress in the treatment of patients with diabetes (4,5). A number of potential mechanisms have been suggested to explain the beneficial effects on CV outcomes (8,20–23). One of these is the reduction of plasma volume due to osmotic diuresis, followed by reduced preload, decreased arterial stiffness and blood pressure, which, in turn, would reduce afterload, leading to an improved coronary circulation with increased subendocardial blood flow (20). Increased hematocrit and an increase in plasma levels of ketones have been suggested to improve oxygenation and mitochondrial energy metabolism of the myocardium, respectively (8,14,21,24). A recent meta-analysis has demonstrated a possible renoprotective effect (6,23). However, the CV and renoprotective mechanisms are still unclear and go beyond effects on glucose control, and, based on the fast onset, primary effects on atherosclerosis are unlikely. Therefore, this study focuses on the early effects, within weeks, of SGLT2 inhibition on cardiac function and metabolism. An additional hypothesis is based on the increased urinary glucose excretion caused by SGLT2 inhibition, which leads to enhanced night-time catabolism, followed by increased glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and production of ketone bodies (24). The increased gluconeogenesis during night-time would inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which would increase autophagy/mitophagy of damaged mitochondria and biogenesis, as well as fusion of mitochondria, maximizing bioenergetic efficiency (22,25), and, possibly, improved myocardial efficiency and contractile work, which will be investigated in this study. 

In the current DAPACARD study, we explore in depth the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on myocardial contractile work, myocardial efficiency, substrate uptake, and cardiac metabolism with MRI, PET, and biomarkers and may help unravel these, and other, effects of dapagliflozin. 

In conclusion, the overall aim with the DAPACARD study is to gain further knowledge about beneficial effects of dapagliflozin on CV outcomes by advanced imaging with MRI and PET as well as biomarkers. This will potentially help laying the foundation to tailor treatment strategies with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM in the future."
18,6475163,2019,BMJ open,The effect of luseogliflozin and alpha-glucosidase inhibitor on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in diabetic patients: rationale and design of the MUSCAT-HF randomised controlled trial,"The MUSCAT-HF trial is an ongoing, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial designed to investigate the drug efficacy of luseogliflozin to reduce BNP in T2DM patients with HFpEF. Eligible participants will be randomised to receive luseogliflozin or voglibose in addition to their background medication for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the percentage change from baseline in BNP level after 12 weeks of treatment. This trial has the potential to provide novel clinical evidence regarding the treatment of HFpEF in the patients with T2DM. 

The EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials showed that the treatment of empagliflozin and canagliflozin, respectively, significantly reduced cardiovascular events in T2DM patients with higher cardiovascular risk.6 8 Specifically, a 35% and 33% relative risk reduction in hospitalisation for heart failure was observed in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials, respectively. Although a significant reduction in hospitalisation for heart failure was clearly documented, the proportion of the patients with heart failure and reduced or preserved ejection fraction was not reported precisely in either trials. Therefore, the therapeutic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors specifically in the patients with heart failure has yet to be established. At present, HFpEF prognosis cannot be improved with the use of conventional drugs such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, beta blocker or mineralocorticoid receptor blocker.14–17 SGLT2 inhibitors therefore represent a promising strategy for the prevention of HFpEF and improvement of HFpEF outcome by improving left ventricular diastolic function in the patients with T2DM. A recent small prospective cohort study in 37 patients showed that canagliflozin improved left ventricular diastolic function within 3 months, although the data in terms of prognosis were limited.18 Further, several clinical trials to investigate the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in cardiovascular clinical hard endpoints in HFpEF patients with T2DM are ongoing (EMPEROR-Preserved; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03057951 and DELIVER; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT0361921). Although our study focused on BNP as surrogate endpoint for worsening of heart failure, the results will provide the evidence for the drug efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitor on pathophysiological aspects in those patients. 

In summary, emerging evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors exert protective effects against cardiovascular events beyond their glucose-lowering capabilities, although further investigation of the mechanisms underlying these effects is warranted. The MUSCAT-HF trial, the results of which are expected to be published in 2019, will provide novel clinical insights into the treatment of the patients with T2DM and HFpEF."
19,6947966,2020,Cardiovascular diabetology,Positive effect of dapagliflozin on left ventricular longitudinal function for type 2 diabetic mellitus patients with chronic heart failure,"The findings of our study indicate that LV longitudinal myocardial function, assessed in terms of GLS for T2DM patients with stable HF, had significantly improved 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin. In addition, improvement of GLS for HFpEF patients was superior to that for non-HFpEF patients. Importantly, improvements of GLS were strongly associated with those in E/e′ 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin. 

LV longitudinal myocardial function in T2DM 
The presence of T2DM has come to be considered an independent predictor of mortality, and also a contributor to the development of HF in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF [1, 2]. It is particularly well known that T2DM is a major cause of HFpEF, while the presence of T2DM is associated with outcome for patients with HFrEF as well as HFpEF. In fact, Sakakibara et al. reported that the prognosis of HFrEF patients due to non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with T2DM was worse than that of those without T2DM, while multivariate analysis showed that T2DM was significantly associated with an increase in the incidence of cardiac events [16]. Diabetes-related cardiomyopathy is presented as a diastolic dysfunction, which had previously been considered the earliest functional alteration in the course of diabetes-related cardiomyopathy. Moreover, LV diastolic dysfunction is thought to be an underlying pathophysiological abnormality of patients with HFpEF, and thus its assessment plays an important role in diagnosis. In addition, it has been reported that LV diastolic dysfunction is also independently associated with outcomes in patients with HFrEF as well as HFpEF [14, 17]. 

On the other hand, LV longitudinal myocardial dysfunction has been identified even in T2DM patients with preserved LVEF but without overt coronary artery disease and overt HF [3–10], so that it, rather than LV diastolic dysfunction, should be currently considered the first marker of a preclinical form of diabetes-related cardiac dysfunction, possibly leading to HFpEF. Ernande et al. showed that LV longitudinal myocardial dysfunction detected as GLS < 18% was present even in T2DM patients with preserved LVEF and even those with normal LV diastolic function [18]. In addition, various factors such as acute hyperglycemia [19] and obesity [20, 21] were associated with LV longitudinal myocardial dysfunction in asymptomatic DM patients with preserved LVEF. Our group also previously showed that LV longitudinal myocardial function was strongly and independently of age associated with LV diastolic function in DM patients with preserved LVEF, in contrast to in normal subjects with age-related LV diastolic dysfunction [8]. Thus, it has been suggested that the presence of T2DM leads to LV longitudinal myocardial dysfunction as well as LV diastolic dysfunction, that LV longitudinal myocardial dysfunction is associated with LV diastolic function, and that reduced LV longitudinal myocardial function can coexist with LV diastolic dysfunction in T2DM patients with preserved LVEF, leading to HFpEF. Moreover, improvement of GLS after administration of dapagliflozin for HFpEF patients was superior to that for non-HFpEF patients in this study. Since LV longitudinal myocardial dysfunction can be considered as the early functional alteration in HF patients, positive effect of dapagliflozin on LV longitudinal function was shown in HF patients whose LV dysfunction was milder (preserved LVEF) rather than those with already severe LV dysfunction (reduced LVEF). Thus, these findings may lead to early intervention of SGLT2 inhibitors for HF patients with T2DM. 

Leung et al. showed that improvements in glycemic control by antidiabetic drugs including insulin (not including SGLT2 inhibitors) led to improvements in GLS as well as LV diastolic function in asymptomatic T2DM patients with preserved LVEF during 12-month follow-up [22]. Moreover, they showed patients who lowered their HbA1c by ≥ 1.0% had a significantly higher relative improvement in GLS than those who did not. Thus, there is a possibility that improvement in GLS might be resulted from better glycemic control irrespective of SGLT2 inhibitors. 

Impact of SGLT2 inhibitor on cardiovascular events in T2DM 
DECLARE-TIMI 58 was a large trial that assessed cardiovascular outcomes for 17,160 patients who were treated with the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and followed for a median of 4.2 years [11]. Main findings from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial were that T2DM patients who were at high risk of cardiovascular events, dapagliflozin was noninferior to placebo with respect to the composite safety outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events, but neither did it result in a significantly lower rate of major adverse cardiovascular events than placebo. Dapagliflozin did result in a lower rate of the other prespecified primary efficacy outcomes such as the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF, which was reflected in a lower rate of hospitalization for HF. Large clinical trials using other SGLT2 inhibitors such as empagliflozin (EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial) [23] and canagliflozin (CANVAS Program) [24] also found that T2DM patients at high risk of cardiovascular events derived cardiovascular benefits from the SGLT2 inhibitor as compared to a placebo. Importantly, a recent large clinical trial, DAPA-HF, which comprised 4744 patients with HFrEF, showed that the risk of the primary composite outcome of worsening HF or death from cardiovascular causes was significantly lower for the dapagliflozin than for the placebo group, regardless of the presence or absence of T2DM [12]. 

It is well known that SGLT2 inhibitor is associated with lower blood pressure and weight loss as well as a reduction in HbA1c levels, changes which in turn have a significant impact on LV function. Moreover, canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of kidney failure as well as cardiovascular events compared to the placebo group for T2DM patients with albuminuric chronic kidney disease, followed up for a median of 2.62 years [25]. Therefore, these multifaceted effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on such risk factors of LV diastolic function may well lead to improvement for T2DM patients with LV diastolic function. Our recent prospective multicenter trial using T2DM patients with stable HF showed that use of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin was associated with improvements in LV diastolic functional parameters including E/e′ and left atrial volume index. Another group also showed positive effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on LV systolic and diastolic function [26], whereas, Roy et al. recently reported that SGLT-2 inhibitors did not appear to the improvement of LV diastolic functional parameters in HFpEF patients with T2DM [27]. In addition, an interesting large randomized clinical trial known as EMPEROR-Preserved Trial is currently in progress. This trial will investigate the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin in approximately 5750 patients with HFpEF regardless of the presence or absence of T2DM [28]. Thus, SGLT2 inhibitors may open a new window on the treatment of HF by the findings from this trial. 

Clinical implications 
Although LV diastolic function also plays an important role for patients with HFrEF as well as HFpEF in the development of cardiovascular events and outcomes, LV longitudinal myocardial function assessed in terms of GLS has been reported to be a sensitive marker of early subtle abnormalities of LV myocardial performance, helpful for the prediction of outcomes for various cardiac diseases, and superior to conventional echocardiographic indices [29–33]. Thus, the utility for HF patient management of GLS in conjunction with HF stage classification rather than of conventional echocardiographic parameters has come to be widely reported [29]. For HF patients, GLS can be useful for the prediction of subclinical LV dysfunction, thus identifying patients more at risk of progressing to HF stage or identifying in detail disease severity or prognosis. Since the presence of T2DM is an independent risk factor for the development of HF and its associated mortality, interest in the assessment of precise risk stratification in T2DM patients has remained strong. In our study reported here, the improvement of LV diastolic function after administration of dapagliflozin was found to be strongly associated with that of in GLS. Thus, effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on LV function is multifactorial [34–36], so that GLS-guided management using dapagliflozin for T2DM with stable HF may therefore potentially be able to prevent progression to later HF and may offer new insights into the management of T2DM with HF. 

Study limitations 
This study comprised a small number of patients and did not use a placebo-controlled group, so that future prospective studies with larger patient populations including placebo-controlled groups will be needed to validate our findings. In fact, EMPA-HEART trial of a prospective study is currently in progress [37]. In this trial, T2DM patients with preserved LVEF are randomized to either empagliflozin or sitagliptin to investigate a change in GLS from baseline to 1 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Furthermore, the use of thiazolidinedione is contraindicated in HF patients, but 11 patients (21%) used thiazolidinedione in this study. When we re-analyzed except for these 11 patients, overall results were similar. Finally, the dose of all randomized clinical trial with dapagliflozin including DECLARE-TIMI 58 was 10 mg/day. However, only one patient received 10 mg/day of dapagliflozin, and others received 5 mg/day of dapagliflozin in this study. Since the starting dose of dapagliflozin was 5 mg/day in Japan, this difference may occur."
20,6977298,2020,Cardiovascular diabetology,Effects of antidiabetic drugs on left ventricular function/dysfunction: a systematic review and network meta-analysis,"In this network meta-analysis, 48 studies were included, comprising a total sample size of 4790 subjects. The 48 studies included 36 RCTs and 12 cohort studies. We found that compared with placebo, GLP-1 agonists increased LVEF and decreased LVESV and E/e′, and SGLT-2 inhibitors decreased LVEDD and E/e′. These results suggested that GLP-1 agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors could improve ventricular remodeling. 

Remodeling is an important determinant of patient morbidity and long-term outcomes. Adverse anatomical remodeling occurs at several levels, including anatomical, metabolic, and neurohormonal remodeling. Anatomical remodeling is characterized by LV dilatation, hypertrophy, and geometrical remodeling (the heart becomes more spherical). 

Our meta-analysis revealed that GLP-1 agonist treatment triggered an increase in the mean change in LVEF% of 2.04% and a decrease in mean change in LVESV of 4.39 ml compared with placebo treatment. GLP-1 agonists were also demonstrated to significantly reduce E/e. Our subgroup analysis suggested that GLP-1 agonists had a better effect on diabetic patients with CVD than patients with CVD alone. GLP-1 agonists [61] are an incretin hormone secreted mainly by intestinal L-cells in response to the presence of nutrients. GLP-1 agonists mimic the effects of the native GLP-1 receptor, which increases insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon secretion, increases satiety and slows gastric emptying [33, 62]. However, the mechanism by which GLP-1 agonists exert their cardiovascular protective action, especially to improve ventricular remodeling, is still unclear. It was reported that liraglutide, one kind of GLP-1 agonist, inhibited angiotensin II and pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling by regulating PI3K/Akt1 and AMPKα signaling [63]. Wang et al. [64] also found that the cardiac protection of GLP-1 agonists might be dependent on inhibition of oxidative stress through the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase pathway. In addition to their weight loss and glucose-lowering effects, GLP-1 agonists have been shown to protect the heart during acute ischemia and improve mitochondrial function, microvascular function, and myocardial glucose uptake in experimental animal models of heart failure [41, 65]. Giblett et al. [61] found that GLP-1 agonists are present in left ventricular cardiomyocytes but are not expressed in vascular tissue, so GLP-1 agonists may have direct ventricular effects and mediate secondary vasodilation through ventricular artery interactions. In addition, GLP-1 agonists increase natriuresis [17], reduce blood pressure, reduce inflammation, reduce ischemic injury, increase heart rate, increase plaque stabilization and decrease smooth muscle proliferation. It has been suggested that the positive effects of GLP-1 agonists on cardiovascular disease may be the result of a direct action on the arteriosclerotic process [66]. All these processes may leave an imprint on GLP-1 agonists’ role in the improvement of ventricular remodeling. 

The results of our study revealed that SGLT-2 inhibitors could significantly reduce LVEDD but could not exert a significant effect on LVEDV. However, SGLT-2 inhibitors could significantly reduce E/e′ and improve diastolic function of the left ventricle. Some studies suggested that SGLT-2 inhibitors could reduce oxidative stress [66], thereby improving arteriosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction. Experimental data in obese and diabetic mice demonstrated that the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin significantly ameliorated cardiac fibrosis, coronary arterial thickening, and cardiac macrophage infiltration, suggesting a direct cardiac effect along with an attenuation of oxidative stress on the myocardium [67]. Previous studies have indicated that SGLT1 receptors are predominantly expressed in the human intestine, and the higher selectivity of SGLT1 receptors could lower the variations in postprandial blood glucose, which might help to reduce heart failure risk. These factors collectively could play a crucial role in reducing the vasculopathy burden on the heart. Other potential beneficial mechanisms, for instance, improved arterial compliance and so on, have also been postulated [67, 68]. Another study found that SGLT-2 inhibitors in addition to tofogliflozin administration had a favorable effect on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in patients with T2DM [65, 69–71]. A network meta-analysis of 91 randomized trials by Yang et al. also found that in terms of heart failure risk, sodium-glucose cotransporters 2 were the most favorable option among all classes of antidiabetic medications [72]. Although SGLT-2 inhibitors seemed to reduce the risk of heart failure, Shao et al. considered that dapagliflozin might have greater effects on heart failure reduction compared to empagliflozin [73]. This study has shown the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on improving LVEDD but not on improving LVEDV. There is a need for much more research in the future due to the paucity of studies on SGLT-2 inhibitors and involved patients. 

Of note, in 2018, a network meta-analysis involving 236 studies and 176,310 subjects found that GLP-1 agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors were significantly associated with lower cardiovascular mortality than were the control treatments, and SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a reduction in heart failure events and myocardial infarction. This study is consistent with our results. 

Although MET did not exert an effect on ventricular remodeling in our conclusion, a number of experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that MET had a beneficial effect on lipids, atherosclerotic thrombosis, inflammation, endothelial function, oxidative stress, and antiproliferative and neuroprotective properties. Based on these findings, the recently published guidelines of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommended [74] either SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists in patients with T2DM who are unable to achieve their target level of glycemic control with MET. Based on our results, MET treatment in combination with GLP-1 agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors may also be a good choice for type 2 diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. 

Our results suggested that DPP-4 inhibitors exerted a significant negative impact on LVEDV. Zheng et al. [75] also found in their meta-analysis that the use of DPP-4 inhibitors was not associated with lower mortality than placebo or no treatment and that the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists was associated with lower mortality than DPP-4 inhibitors. Studies have found that DPP-4 inhibitor therapy did not increase the overall risk of major cardiovascular and renal outcomes but increased the hospitalization rate for heart failure [76]. Uncleaved brain natriuretic peptides, which are known to be substrates of the enzyme DPP-4, might be associated with decompensated HF [77]. Moreover, an increase in LVEDV should result in an increase in the ejection fraction according to the Frank-Starling law. However, our study found that although LVEDV increased with the use of DPP-4 inhibitors, LVEF did not increase. McMurray et al. found that vildagliptin had no major effect on LVEF but did lead to an increase in left ventricular volumes with type 2 diabetes and heart failure [38]. This finding was consistent with our results. A lack of EF increase suggests a negative impact of DPP-4 inhibitors on myocardial contractility. Studies have reported that DPP-4 inhibition is accompanied by increases in myocardial cAMP, which are related to potentiation of endogenous GLP-1. The increases in cAMP may exacerbate the clinical course of heart failure [78, 79]. DPP-4 inhibition might exacerbate the clinical course of heart failure via pathways of SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor 1)/CaMKII (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II). These factors collectively might damage cardiomyocytes, which may be the reason why LVEDV increased, but LVEF did not [80]. Therefore, this result suggests that we should be cautious about the use of DPP-4 inhibitors in type 2 diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease because DPP-4 inhibitors may have adverse effects on cardiac function. 

Limitations 
First, this paper included studies that covered three types of patients: one was type 2 diabetic patients, another was cardiovascular patients, and the third was patients with comorbidities of the first two. This may lead to between-studies heterogeneity and exert a certain impact on the combined results. Second, given that the sample size of the included studies ranged from 15 to 559, there was a lack of controlled clinical trials with a large sample size to conduct a more powerful demonstration of our outcome. Third, the variability of the ventricular structural changes estimated by echocardiography may exaggerate or ignore the therapeutic effect, leading to between-studies heterogeneity."
21,4361459,2015,Diabetes & vascular disease research,SGLT-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk: Proposed pathways and review of ongoing outcome trials,"Given the increasing prevalence of T2DM in populations worldwide and suboptimal control of glycaemia and other CV risk factors achieved with currently available agents, the need for therapies with novel modes of action remains an important clinical priority. Of the large number of antihyperglycaemic drug classes now available for patients with T2DM, none is recognized unequivocally to reduce CV events over and above any modest effects of glucose lowering itself. Metformin, which is widely viewed as having CV benefits, has actually never been studied in a large properly designed randomized clinical trial powered to answer this specific question. 

SGLT-2 inhibitors are novel oral glucose-lowering agents that offer the potential to improve glycaemic control with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, independent of insulin secretion, offering a modest reduction in BP and body weight. Their mode of action, which is independent of endogenous insulin secretion, enables their use in any stage of T2DM. However, while the potential for CV benefits from the SGLT-2 inhibitors is alluring, an actual effect on CV outcomes remains to be proven. 

Preliminary attempts have been made to quantify long-term effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on macrovascular events. These have included pooled analyses, showing beneficial trends, from smaller randomized trials being performed primarily to demonstrate glucose-lowering efficacy and an in silico analysis of uncertain value. Given the frequent discordance between the suspected and actual effects of antihyperglycaemic agents on CV disease, it is important to await the results of properly powered outcome trials specifically designed to assess CV safety and/or benefits.86 Greater knowledge concerning the CV effects of our glucose-lowering therapies is essential for improved evidence-based management of patients with T2DM. As for the class of SGLT-2 inhibitors, we anticipate first reports from ongoing CV outcome trials in 2015."
22,5054919,2015,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Effect of canagliflozin on serum uric acid in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Canagliflozin decreased serum uric acid levels in patients with T2DM, including a subset of patients with hyperuricaemia. Furthermore, 20–30% of patients with hyperuricaemia were able to achieve normal serum uric acid levels (<6 mg/dl) with canagliflozin. Previous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that this reduction in serum uric acid levels relates to an increased fractional excretion of uric acid during the first weeks of canagliflozin treatment 12. By week 12, the total urinary uric acid excretion returned to near baseline levels, probably reflecting the persistent reduction in serum uric acid concentrations. 

The mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors reduce serum uric acid has not been established; however, it may possibly involve the renal SLC2A9 (GLUT9) transporter, which is known to exchange glucose for uric acid 13. Higher glucose concentrations in the urine attributable to canagliflozin treatment could lead to an increased exchange of uric acid in the apical membrane of tubular cells. Consequently, this would result in increased release of uric acid from blood into the urine, reducing serum uric acid levels 13. This potential mechanism is supported by evidence of trans‐stimulation of uric acid efflux with high glucose concentrations in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC2A9b 14. 

In conclusion, both doses of canagliflozin reduced serum uric acid levels in patients with T2DM. Furthermore, up to 30% of patients with baseline hyperuricaemia and T2DM achieved normal serum acid levels with canagliflozin after 26 weeks. Whether such changes have other beneficial effects on renal and/or cardiovascular complications will require evaluation in longer‐term studies."
24,5057299,2015,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Effects of empagliflozin on blood pressure and markers of arterial stiffness and vascular resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes,"The objective of the present post hoc analysis was to explore the effects of empagliflozin on BP, arterial stiffness and vascular resistance in patients with T2DM. In both of the cohorts studied, empagliflozin reduced BP, without increasing heart rate, and had favourable effects on markers of arterial stiffness and vascular resistance as well as on a marker of myocardial workload. 

The differences in baseline SBP, DBP and PP with increasing age were, as expected, based on population data. After the age of 50 years, SBP continues to increase, while DBP tends to remain fairly stable between ages 50 and 60 years and then decrease, leading to a widening PP 30. These changes suggest that large artery stiffness becomes the predominant haemodynamic factor driving increases in SBP in individuals aged >60 years, while peripheral vascular resistance drives BP in younger individuals 30. 

As we hypothesized, the greatest reductions in PP were observed in the oldest patients and in those with the highest SBP at baseline. MAP was reduced in all the subgroups, with no greater reduction in patients with higher age or SBP at baseline. This is explained by the dominance of DBP in the measurement of MAP, which means that MAP reflects small artery resistance and cardiac output to a greater extent than PP. It appears, therefore, that empagliflozin is efficacious across the entire age range but its effects may differ with age; for example, in younger patients, BP reduction may be mediated via effects on small artery resistance and, in the elderly, largely via effects on large artery stiffness. The reduction in the DP (or RPP), a marker of cardiac workload, observed with empagliflozin was driven by reduction in SBP; empagliflozin had a neutral effect on heart rate in this analysis, consistent with the results of previous trials in patients with T2DM and with the results of a study on the effects of empagliflozin on heart rate variability in patients with T1DM 29. The reduction in the DP (or RPP) is intriguing from the perspective of its prognostic impact on CV and total mortality, but also from a congestive heart failure perspective, and it is tempting to speculate that empagliflozin may reduce hospitalization for heart failure. Interestingly, in a 16‐week study in a diabetic hypertensive rat model of heart failure, empagliflozin was observed to have beneficial effects on cardiac morphology and function 31. 

The observation that empagliflozin has an impact on the vasculature without increasing pulse rate is interesting from a CV perspective and could be interpreted as a consequence of a relative reduction in the sympathetic nervous system tonus. Although neurohormonal factors could also play a role, this notion is supported by mechanistic data from normotensive patients with T2DM in whom no apparent changes in muscle sympathetic nerve activity, measured using microneurography, were observed, despite clinical benefits with regard to BP and weight 32. 

Reductions in SBP and DBP have consistently been observed with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM 33, but no data in humans have been published on reductions in arterial stiffness or vascular resistance with SGLT2 inhibitors other than empagliflozin. As no other classes of glucose‐lowering drugs, including dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors and GLP‐1 receptor analogues, have shown similar findings, the observed improvements in arterial stiffness and vascular resistance could be a unique phenomenon for empagliflozin, which could have major implications for vascular health and CV prognosis. 

The mechanisms by which empagliflozin reduces BP and arterial stiffness are not fully understood, but may be related to improved glycaemic control, weight loss, volume contraction as a result of osmotic diuresis or reduced oxidative stress 29, 33, 34, 35, 36. In a rat model, empagliflozin was further shown to normalize endothelial function, reduce oxidative stress in aortic vessels, reverse a pro‐inflammatory phenotype, and improve AGE/RAGE signalling 37, all pathways of potential importance to a reduction in arterial stiffness 36. In addition, in a mouse model of obesity and T2DM, empagliflozin ameliorated pericoronary arterial fibrosis, coronary arterial thickening and cardiac macrophage infiltration, effects that are associated with attenuation of oxidative stress in CV tissue 38. 

In this analysis, events consistent with volume depletion were rare and no such events were reported in patients aged ≥75 years; however, the potential for volume depletion in vulnerable patients such as the elderly, those with renal impairment, those with low SBP and those receiving diuretics is acknowledged in the prescribing information for SGLT2 inhibitors 39, 40, 41 and appropriate caution should be exercised in the use of empagliflozin in such patients in clinical practice. 

Strengths of the analyses presented in this manuscript include the large number of patients analysed (cohort 2) and the use of 24‐h ABPM in patients with hypertension (cohort 1). Limitations include the post hoc nature of the analyses, the relatively small number of patients in the older age groups, that the analyses did not account for multiple testing, and the short exposure period to the drug (12 or 24 weeks). In addition, there were few Asian patients with advanced hypertension, which limits the generalizability of our findings to this population. 

Indirect evidence suggests that reductions in arterial stiffness and vascular resistance may reduce CV risk beyond BP reduction 42, 43. Reductions in BP and arterial stiffness are two of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors that might ameliorate CV risk and heart failure in patients with T2DM 44. The effects of empagliflozin on CV and microvascular outcomes are being investigated in the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME® trial (NCT01131676) 45, which will report results in the second half of 2015."
26,5504200,2017,Advances in therapy,Safety and Tolerability of Empagliflozin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: Pooled Analysis of Phase I-III Clinical Trials.,"This comprehensive analysis of pooled safety data based on more than 15,000 patient-years’ exposure to empagliflozin was undertaken to characterize the safety and tolerability of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM. The results confirmed that empagliflozin is well tolerated in this patient population. 

Hypoglycemia is a major concern in patients with T2DM [27]. In this large data set, empagliflozin was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia compared with placebo, except for in participants on background sulfonylurea. Empagliflozin would not be expected to be associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia given its insulin-independent mechanism of action [1]. However, sulfonylureas, which stimulate insulin secretion, are associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia [27], and an increase in hypoglycemia has also been reported when other SGLT2 inhibitors are used in combination with a sulfonylurea [28, 29]. When empagliflozin is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, a lower dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin should be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [15]. 

Treatment with empagliflozin leads to transient natriuresis and increases in urine volume [2, 3]. The potential for hypotension in patients treated with empagliflozin is acknowledged in the prescribing information [15], particularly in patients who are elderly. In this large data set, the incidence of events consistent with volume depletion was similar between empagliflozin and placebo, except for a greater incidence with empagliflozin in participants aged 75 years or older and in participants receiving loop diuretics at baseline. 

In this analysis of pooled data, the incidence of events consistent with UTI was similar in participants treated with empagliflozin and placebo. The incidence of events consistent with genital infection was higher in participants treated with empagliflozin than with placebo, but such events were mild or moderate in most participants and rarely led to treatment discontinuation. An increased risk of genital infections has also been observed with other SGLT2 inhibitors [30, 31]. 

On the basis of a meta-analysis of phase IIb and phase III clinical trials, the US Food and Drug Administration warned that the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin may increase the risk of bladder cancer [32] and this is acknowledged in the dapagliflozin product label [33]. Several post-marketing studies are ongoing to ascertain the level of risk. The available safety data for empagliflozin do not suggest an association between empagliflozin and malignancies in patients with T2DM. 

Small decreases in eGFR were observed in all treatment groups, with larger declines in the placebo group than in the empagliflozin groups. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, an initial decrease in eGFR was observed with empagliflozin. Thereafter, during long-term administration, eGFR remained stable in patients treated with empagliflozin and declined steadily in the placebo group. After cessation of study drug, eGFR increased in the empagliflozin groups, such that eGFR was significantly higher with empagliflozin than placebo at the post-treatment follow-up visit [12]. These observations suggest that the initial decrease in eGFR in patients treated with empagliflozin is due to hemodynamic effects and that empagliflozin has the potential to slow decline in renal function in patients with T2DM [12]. Of note, in our analysis, there was no increase in the incidence of events consistent with decreased renal function, including acute kidney injury, with empagliflozin vs. placebo. 

It has been hypothesized that SGLT2 inhibitors might increase the risk of bone fractures because of modulation of renal reabsorption of calcium and phosphate [34, 35]. In this large data set, the incidence of bone fractures was similar in participants treated with empagliflozin and placebo. There were no changes from baseline in calcium or phosphate levels with empagliflozin, and no notable changes from baseline in other bone markers with empagliflozin. Previous studies have found no notable changes in calcium or phosphate levels with empagliflozin in patients with T2DM and chronic kidney disease [4] or in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease [13]. 

Increases in HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol have been observed in some trials of empagliflozin [5–8], which may be partly due to hemoconcentration [36]. In this pooled analysis, small increases in LDL-cholesterol were observed in the empagliflozin groups; small increases in HDL-cholesterol were observed in the empagliflozin 25 mg group. In this pooled analysis of data from the clinical trial setting, increased urine ketone levels were reported in a greater proportion of participants on empagliflozin than placebo, but the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis was very low and no higher in participants treated with empagliflozin than placebo. The incidence of events consistent with hepatic injury was similar in participants treated with empagliflozin and placebo. 

Regulators have recently completed a review of the available data for possible associations between the SGLT2 inhibitor class and lower limb amputations, concluding that canagliflozin may increase the risk of lower limb amputation [37, 38]. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a boxed warning to the label for canagliflozin describing the increased risk of leg and foot amputations [38]. A review of the available data for possible associations between SGLT2 inhibitors and acute pancreatitis is ongoing. No evidence of an association between empagliflozin and lower limb amputations or acute pancreatitis was found in this large data set from the clinical trial setting. 

Strengths of this analysis include the large sample size and exposure. Limitations include that the studies were of varying durations and that differences between groups were not compared using modelled analyses. The analysis of lower limb amputations should be interpreted with caution because of the manual retrieval and validation of such cases. Overall, the results of this analysis of pooled safety data support a favorable benefit–risk profile of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM."
31,6710883,2019,Cardiovascular diabetology,Improved home BP profile with dapagliflozin is associated with amelioration of albuminuria in Japanese patients with diabetic nephropathy: the Yokohama add-on inhibitory efficacy of dapagliflozin on albuminuria in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes study (Y-AIDA study).,"The main finding of this prospective, multicenter, interventional, single-arm study was that add-on dapagliflozin therapy for 24 weeks reduced albuminuria without decreasing eGFR in Japanese patients with T2DM and early-stage DN (eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR ≥ 30 mg/gCr), concomitant with improvement in home BP profile. Three new findings were obtained in this study: (i) dapagliflozin decreased out-of-office BP, which contributed to the ameliorating effects of dapagliflozin on albuminuria; (ii) dapagliflozin improved BP variability, which is an indicator of BP quality control; and (iii) Japanese patients with T2DM and DN, who have high salt sensitivity genetically and high dietary salt intake, were enrolled as the study population [37, 38].

In this study, UACR was significantly reduced after 8 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, and this beneficial effect continued until 24 weeks after the start of dapagliflozin treatment, with no reduction in eGFR observed at 24 weeks. This finding suggests that dapagliflozin exerts rapid and sustained renal protective effects on DN, consistent with results from previous studies using SGLT2 inhibitors [10–13, 39–47].

SGLT2 inhibitors are anti-hyperglycemic agents with well-characterized clinical efficacy in the treatment of T2DM. This class of drugs is also reported to exert pleiotropic effects such as decreased body weight, lowered BP, improved arterial stiffness, improvements in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and amelioration in endothelial function [9, 11, 14, 15, 39, 43–45, 48–58]. In the current study, glucose-lowering and pleiotropic effects of dapagliflozin were consistently demonstrated [9, 11, 14, 15, 39, 43–45, 48–56]. Although the treatment period with dapagliflozin was only 24 weeks in the present study, short-term improvements in risk markers, especially the albuminuria-lowering properties, with dapagliflozin predict long-term outcomes in patients with T2DM and CKD [59]. The outcomes of several recent clinical trials, such as the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS program, and DECLARE-TIMI 58 studies, have indicated the renal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors for T2DM patients [10–12]. However, these trials mainly included T2DM patients without DN, and only 10–20% of the patient populations were Asian. Evidence of effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on UACR was limited in Asian patients [60]. More recently, the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial also demonstrated the renal protective effects of a SGLT2 inhibitor for T2DM patients with nephropathy [13]. In the CREDENCE trial, the Asian population was also 19.9%, and out-of-office BPs were not measured. Thus, in the present Y-AIDA study, we focused on Japanese patients with T2DM and DN as the study population. Additionally, we investigated the effects of dapagliflozin on the home BP profile as the key secondary endpoint. Recently, there has been an increasing number of reports about the renal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in T2DM patients with nephropathy [46, 47, 61]. However, there are no reports that have investigated whether SGLT2 inhibitors lower out-of-office BPs in T2DM patients with nephropathy. Additionally, effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on circadian BP patterns, or BP variability, are unknown in T2DM patients with nephropathy.

In the present study, we used a novel home BP measurement device (HEM-7252G-HP) to evaluate the effects of dapagliflozin on out-of-office BP [24]. SGLT2 inhibitors reportedly lower daytime, nocturnal, and 24-h mean BP estimated by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) in hypertensive patients with T2DM [14, 39, 48–52, 62]. However, these studies were of short duration (4–12 weeks), and mainly included T2DM patients without DN. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that add-on dapagliflozin therapy lowers not only morning and evening home BP levels but also nocturnal home BP level over long-term treatment of up to 24 weeks in patients with T2DM and DN. Interestingly, the UACR-reducing effect of dapagliflozin did not correlate with an improvement in glucose metabolism and decrease in body weight or office BP. However, there was a significant correlation between the dapagliflozin-mediated reduction in UACR and the lowering of home mean BP levels. For a causal relationship between reduction in UACR and improvement in the home mean BP levels, it is well known that appropriate blood pressure control can reduce proteinuria in patients with T2DM [7]. Conversely, a decrease in proteinuria could affect blood pressure. It is reported that urinary serine proteases caused by massive proteinuria activate the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which leads to increased sodium retention/extracellular fluid and elevated BP in nephrotic syndrome [63, 64]. Although none of the patients in the present study had proteinuria in the nephrotic range, the possibility that dapagliflozin-mediated reduction in albuminuria could lead to a decrease in home BP levels could not be excluded. Additionally, we performed the multivariate linear regression analysis to examine whether the dapagliflozin-induced reduction in the home mean BP levels affected the decrease in UACR. The results showed that the only change in morning home systolic BP was an independent determinant of the decrease in log-UACR. These results suggest that an improved home BP profile contributes to the ameliorating effects of dapagliflozin on albuminuria in T2DM patients with DN.

Asian patients genetically have a high salt sensitivity and a high dietary salt intake [37, 38], and the BP-lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibitors would be a result of their osmotic diuresis and mild natriuresis [39, 65]. Osmotic diuresis might contribute to early decreases in BP by reducing extracellular fluid during SGLT2 inhibitor therapy [66, 67], with natriuresis playing a role in longer term BP reductions [65]. Additionally, dapagliflozin decreases the tissue sodium content of the skin in T2DM patients [68]. Generally, diuretics such as loop and thiazide lower nocturnal BP more than daytime BP [69]. However, in the present study, after add-on dapagliflozin treatment for 24 weeks, the proportion of dippers and extreme-dippers was decreased, and the proportion of non-dippers and risers was increased. These changes might reflect greater reductions in daytime BP compared with those of nocturnal BP. Previous studies also demonstrated that BP reduction with SGLT2 inhibitors persisted throughout a 24-h day with a greater reduction in BP during the daytime compared with nighttime in T2DM patients using ABPM [62]. Kario et al. [70] also reported that empagliflozin treatment for 12 weeks decreased 24-h BP with greater reductions in daytime BP compared with nighttime BP in Japanese patients with T2DM and uncontrolled nocturnal hypertension. This may be partially attributed to the glucose-dependent nature of glycemic control with SGLT2 inhibitors. Osmotic diuresis with SGLT2 inhibitors is likely increased during daytime periods because of higher food and fluid intake. However, urine production during nighttime periods is lower because of circadian rhythms in kidney function. Fluctuation in the sympathetic tone may also affect differences in daytime and nighttime BP regulation with SGLT2 inhibitors.

The current study also showed that add-on dapagliflozin therapy improved the day-by-day variability of home BP, an indicator of quality of BP control, in addition to mean office and home BP levels. Recent studies indicate that the measurement of day-by-day variability of home BP provides a clinically useful distinction between high- and low-CVD risk groups in hypertensive patients [71]. With respect to a possible relationship between BP variability and the progression of renal impairment in T2DM, an increase in day-by-day variability of home BP was reported to be associated with exacerbated albuminuria in T2DM patients with DN [21, 22]. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that improved BP variability with dapagliflozin partially contributed to the amelioration of DN, and this is the first report to show that SGLT2 inhibitors can not only lower mean BP levels but also improve the quality of BP control.

In the present study, we evaluated urinary biomarkers and oxidative stress markers to explore the mechanism by which dapagliflozin reduces albuminuria in T2DM patients with DN. A decreasing trend was observed for dROMs, an oxidative stress marker, although the change was not statistically significant. Dapagliflozin has been shown to suppress inflammation and oxidative stress in the kidneys of a mouse model of T2DM [72]. In another study with a T2DM mouse model, SGLT2 inhibitors improved albuminuria, glomerular hyperfiltration, and mesangial matrix expansion via an improvement in oxidative stress in the glomerulus [73]. The results of the present study indicate that dapagliflozin may have the potential to reduce oxidative stress in the kidneys of T2DM patients with DN. Some studies reported that improvement in oxidative stress by dapagliflozin contributed to the amelioration of endothelial function in T2DM patients [57, 58]. Sub-clinical inflammation is also involved in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction, which leads to vascular complications including nephropathy in diabetic patients [36]. However, in this study, add-on dapagliflozin therapy for 24 weeks did not change the pro-inflammatory markers such as WBC and Plt. Further studies are therefore required to determine the mechanism responsible for the renal protective action of SGLT2 inhibitors in DN.

The limitations of the present study were as follows. First, the trial design included a single arm, meaning that bias and placebo effects could not be excluded. Second, albuminuria was evaluated through single-spot urine sampling, which may have contributed to large variations in the data. Methods such as 24-h urine collection or multiple spot sampling may provide a more accurate evaluation of albuminuria. Third, this study may be underpowered to estimate the association between the log-UACR decrease and changes in other cardiometabolic parameters because the sample size calculation was based on the expected changes in log-UACR. Fourth, post-prandial glucose levels and continuous glucose monitoring were not measured in this study. It was unknown whether dapagliflozin treatment improved glucose variability, and whether the change in glucose variability affected an improvement in log-UACR."
33,6990905,2020,International journal of biological sciences,Empagliflozin Attenuates Hyperuricemia by Upregulation of ABCG2 via AMPK/AKT/CREB Signaling Pathway in Type 2 Diabetic Mice.,"The present study was firstly conducted in the model of T2DM mice with HUA, and demonstrated that empagliflozin treatment improved HUA through enhancing ABCG2 expression via AMPK/AKT/CREB pathway in both kidney and ileum. A remarkable improvement in biochemical parameters and histopathologic changes in vivo were observed after empagliflozin treatment, indicating the SUA-lowering effect of empagliflozin. Notably, our data from HK-2 cells after empagliflozin and AMPK inhibitor Compound C treatment further confirmed the mechanism that empagliflozin exerted anti-hyperglycemic effect in vitro.

HUA carries a significant risk for developing various diseases in T2DM 4-8, therefore, exploring the metabolism of UA and associated diseases has attracted researchers' much attention. However, it is a challenge to create hyperuricemic models in mice, because in rodents, uricase oxidizes UA to allantoin which is highly soluble in water and excreted unchanged in the urine, but not in humans 24. As potassium oxonate (PO) can block uricase, and hypoxanthine (HX) is the precursor of UA which is finally oxidized into UA by xanthine oxidase, combination of PO and HX has been widely used to induce HUA in rodents 25-27. As our data indicated, we successfully induced HUA in KK-Ay mice by combination of peritoneal injection of PO and intragastric administration of HX. Meanwhile, empagliflozin administration markedly suppressed SUA in KK-Ay mice with HUA, suggesting the hypouricemic effect of empagliflozin in T2DM mice.

It is well known that kidney is the main organ for excretion of approximately two thirds of the total UA 28. UA handling involves several classes of UA transporters responsible for UA handing. In brief, after glomerular filtration, UA is reabsorbed through URAT1 and GLUT9, and secreted through ABCG2, OAT1, and OAT3. According to previous studies, about one third of the total UA was excreted into the intestinal tract 29, and decreased extra-renal UA excretion is a common cause of HUA 30. Intestinal transporters play significant roles in mediating UA mobilization as well. ABCG2 is expressed on the apical membrane in intestines as well as kidneys 31. ABCG2 regulates SUA via physiologically important roles in both renal and intestinal UA excretion 31. Increased SUA in patients with ABCG2 dysfunction could be explained by the decreased excretion of UA from the intestine 32. Previous studies suggested that GLUT9 which was localized to the apical and basolateral enterocyte membranes, was abundantly expressed in intestine 33, 34, especially in the jejunum and ileum 34. Furthermore, it functioned to regulate enterocyte UA clearance, and enterocyte GLUT9-deficient mice developed HUA, hyperuricosuria and early-onset metabolic syndrome 34. Consistently, we detected low expression of ABCG2 in the KK-Ay group and KK-Ay+HUA group. In contrast, after empagliflozin administration, the SUA were decreased and the ABCG2 expression was up-regulated in both renal and ileal tissues in KK-Ay mice. This finding suggested that empagliflozin might exert anti-hyperuricemic effects by facilitating UA excretion through promoting ABCG2 expression in kidneys and ilea.

SGLT2 inhibitors have recently emerged as a promising novel class of glucose lowering drugs to facilitate glucose excretion in urine independent of insulin 35. Accumulating data indicated their anti- hyperuricemic effects in both clinical 18, 19, 36 and basic studies 37, 38. One of basic studies performed in vitro using Xenopus oocytes indicated that luseogliflozin lowered the SUA level due to inhibition of UA reabsorption mediated by GLUT9 isoform 2 at the collecting duct of the renal tubule 38. Another study conducted in STZ-induced diabetic rats suggested that empagliflozin may exert anti-hyperuricemic effects via regulating URAT1 and ABCG2 37. However, our study demonstrated that empagliflozin promoted ABCG2 expression in kidney and ileum in KK-Ay mice with HUA, but has little impact on the other transporters. The difference of the animal model may explain the difference to a certain extent. Although SGLT2 transporters are primarily located in the kidney, they are also found in other tissues, such as the small intestine, especially ileum 39. In our investigation, we also confirmed that SGLT2 was expressed in ileum (Supplemental figure. 2A-B).

Empagliflozin has been previously reported to trigger AMPK activation 40, which increased phosphorylation of AKT 41, resulting in CREB phosphorylation 42. Furthermore, a previous study implied that the CREB facilitated ABCG2 expression through promoter activation 43. The present study showed that empagliflozin treatment significantly promoted CREB directly bind to ABCG2 promoter through activating AMPK/AKT/CREB pathway. Moreover, with the application of AMPK inhibitor (Compound C), our data further confirmed that empagliflozin enhanced ABCG2 expression by promoting phosphorylation of AMPK, AKT and CREB."
35,4833807,2016,Advances in therapy,"Impact of Reduced Renal Function on the Glucose-Lowering Effects of Luseogliflozin, a Selective SGLT2 Inhibitor, Assessed by Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.","In this post hoc subanalysis, we investigated the impact of renal function decline on the glucose-lowering effects of luseogliflozin, including 24-h glucose variability, as well as pharmacodynamic variables. For the purpose of this subanalysis, we divided the patients into three groups based on their baseline eGFR: normal renal function, normal-to-mildly reduced renal function, and mild-to-moderately reduced renal function.

There were no significant differences in the demographic and baseline characteristics of between groups of patients, with the exceptions of eGFR and urinary albumin corrected for urinary creatinine.

We noted some differences in the variables derived from 24-h CGM among the three groups of patients. Although luseogliflozin decreased the fasting glucose concentrations (i.e., before each meal and in the sleeping period) in all three groups, it did not significantly reduce the postprandial glucose concentrations relative to placebo in the mild–moderate group. Furthermore, consistent with our original findings [13], luseogliflozin significantly increased the cumulative UGE compared with placebo in each of the three groups. However, the placebo-subtracted change in UGE was slightly smaller in the mild–moderate group than in the other two groups. This result is consistent with those of a previous study showing that UGE is attenuated in patients with renal impairment, owing to a reduction in glucose filtered through the glomeruli [12]. It seems feasible that luseogliflozin could not suppress the sharp glucose fluctuations in the postprandial periods in the mild–moderate group owing to the reduced amount of glucose that can be filtered through the glomerulus in individuals with reduced renal function. In normal conditions, the kidney can filter about 180 g of glucose per day, and this amount is likely to be reduced in individuals with reduced renal function. In fasting conditions (i.e., before each meal and overnight), the amount of glucose filtered through the kidney is likely to be relatively stable and manageable in all patients, albeit at a lower level in patients with reduced renal function than in patients with normal renal function. However, in patients with reduced renal function, the kidney is less able to respond to sudden increases in glucose concentrations, especially after a meal, limiting the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on UGE. Nevertheless, the placebo-subtracted change in fasting glucose was smaller in the mild–moderate group than in the other groups, probably because of the lower baseline value in this group, being closer to the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption in the kidney [14]. The fasting glucose concentrations with luseogliflozin were similar between groups, which might be related to the renal threshold for glucose and the low risk of hypoglycemia in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.

Luseogliflozin also decreased insulin concentrations and decreased the AUC of insulin in all of the groups. It is possible that these changes were driven by the reductions in circulating glucose concentrations. These findings suggest that luseogliflozin may reduce insulin secretion in patients with normal renal function or mildly reduced renal function. It is also notable that luseogliflozin increased plasma glucagon concentrations throughout the day in all three groups. This effect of luseogliflozin may be due to enhanced gluconeogenesis to prevent excessive reductions in circulating glucose, especially in fasting conditions.

Several pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies have demonstrated that the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on UGE and plasma glucose concentrations are attenuated by reduced renal function, especially severely reduced renal function or chronic kidney disease [6, 15–18], consistent with our findings using 24-h CGM. Our results provide further insight into the impact of reduced renal function on the glucose-lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, and that co-administration of a SGLT2 inhibitor with another antidiabetic drug, which improves postprandial glucose, might be useful for the patients with reduced renal function if improvements in glucose concentrations are not observed with monotherapy. It is particularly notable that the effects of luseogliflozin on postprandial glucose concentrations were attenuated in individuals with mild–moderate reductions in renal function relative to the other groups, but the reduction in fasting blood glucose was essentially unaffected by reduced renal function. Therefore, the reduced efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors on overall glycemic control (i.e., HbA1c) is likely to be driven by the smaller reductions in postprandial glucose fluctuations, a major contributor to overall glycemic variability.

It is also important to consider that reduced renal function may increase systemic exposure to luseogliflozin, as has been demonstrated for dapagliflozin [19]. An increase in exposure may increase the risk of unwanted side effects, and dose adjustments may be necessary in individuals with moderate-to-severely reduced renal function, although this possibility must be evaluated in longer term studies of patients with moderate-to-severely reduced renal function.

Some limitations of this study warrant mention. In particular, because these subanalyses were conducted in a post hoc exploratory manner, the number of patients differed between groups. Accordingly, it will be necessary to conduct prospective studies of larger numbers of patients to examine the impact of reduced renal function on the glucose-lowering effects of luseogliflozin and the implications, if any, on the clinical use of luseogliflozin. In addition, we did not enroll patients with moderate-to-severely reduced renal function. Considering that the changes in glucose-related variables were lower in the mild–moderate group than in the normal and normal–moderate groups, it is possible that moderate-to-severely reduced renal function will attenuate the clinical efficacy of luseogliflozin by reducing UGE and affecting glucose variability. Indeed, in a 24-week randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Japanese patients with T2DM, ipragliflozin significantly improved glycemic control in patients with mildly reduced renal function but not in patients with moderately reduced renal function [20]. However, it was reported that canagliflozin significantly reduced HbA1c, body weight, and blood pressure among patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (defined as eGFR ≥30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) [21]. Therefore, it will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy of luseogliflozin in patients with moderate-to-severely reduced renal function and in patients with mildly reduced renal function. Finally, patients were only administered luseogliflozin and placebo for 7 days each. Therefore, longer studies are required to examine the clinical relevance of the present results in terms of the changes in HbA1c."
36,4792392,2016,PloS one,Ipragliflozin Improves Hepatic Steatosis in Obese Mice and Liver Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Irrespective of Body Weight Reduction.,"In the present study, we demonstrated that ipragliflozin improved hepatic steatosis irrespective of body weight reduction in obese mice with insulin resistance. Ipragliflozin increased appetite and energy intake in the obese mice, which attenuated body weight reduction by urinary calorie loss. In patients with T2DM, ipragliflozin improved liver dysfunction irrespective of body weight reduction. These findings suggest a novel effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on lipid accumulation in the body, and a clinical implication for the therapeutic effect on hepatic steatosis in patients with T2DM. Based on the findings from the animal study, we consider that some of these effects resulted from their insulin-independent actions on lowering blood glucose.

Recently some papers reporting the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on HFD-fed mice have been published. Treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor tofogliflozin reduced HFD-induced body weight gain as well as hepatic steatosis, when it is administered for 20 weeks beginning at the start of HFD feeding [20]. In contrast, 4-week treatment of remogliflozin following 11-week of HFD feeding attenuated hepatic steatosis without changing body weight gain [21]. Although composition and starting age of HFD in the report were not identical, the protocol of remogliflozin treatment in the study resulted in similar findings to our study. Other recent report has shown that luseogliflozin decreased liver weight and serum ALT levels in STZ-treated mice fed a HFD, without affecting body weight gain [15]. Taken together, these observations suggest that the study protocol, especially in the timing of administration of SGLT2 inhibitors during HFD feeding and a mouse model, could affect body weight gain. In addition, it is possible that pharmacologic differences among SGLT2 inhibitors resulted in the variety of phenotypes. Further studies are necessary to ascertain the issue.

Ipragliflozin increased appetite and energy intake in HFD-fed mice, which attenuated body weight reduction by urinary calorie loss. It is independent of leptin action because ipragliflozin promoted hyperphagia and diminished the change of body weight in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Our observations are consistent with previous reports in mice [20, 21, 22] and rats [13] treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. Because the amount of increased energy intake induced by ipragliflozin treatment was roughly comparable to that of urinary calorie loss in our study, it is likely that ipragliflozin enhanced appetite without affecting other metabolic activities such as thermogenesis and locomotor activity. These observations imply that there are mechanisms in response to urinary glucose excretion to enhance appetite, and further studies are required to elucidate the detailed mechanisms.

Despite a lack of body weight reduction, ipragliflozin markedly improved hepatic steatosis in both HFD-fed and ob/ob mice. Lipid accumulation in the liver occurs due to an imbalance between hepatic TG synthesis and fatty acid oxidation. Both insulin and glucose stimulate gene expression of Srebp1c, a major transcription factor that positively regulates de novo lipogenic enzymes in the liver [23–25]. De novo lipogenesis is largely involved in inducing hepatic steatosis as demonstrated in a previous report showing that SREBP-1 ablation protected ob/ob mice from hepatic steatosis irrespective of adiposity and systemic glucose metabolism [26]. In the present study, ipragliflozin attenuated hyperinsulinemia probably via improving hyperglycemia in obese mice with insulin resistance, associated with reduced gene expression of de novo lipogenesis including Srebp1c and Acc1 in the liver. In addition, elevation of fasting serum 3-hydroxybutyrate levels suggest enhanced fatty acid oxidation in the liver of ipragliflozin-treated mice. Although expression of β-oxidation-related genes were not affected by ipragliflozin treatment in the liver, it could not deny the possibility of increased fatty acid oxidation because CPT1 activity is allosterically regulated by malonyl-CoA synthesized via ACC [27]. Therefore, we consider that both decrease of de novo lipogenesis and increase of fatty acid oxidation contribute to improve hepatic steatosis by ipragliflozin treatment.

It has been demonstrated that hepatic steatosis is associated with the loss of epididymal fat mass in HFD-fed mice [28]. We and others have reported that fibrosis of white adipose tissue limits its lipid-storage capacity via inhibiting adipocyte hypertrophy, which has a role in ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver [18, 29]. In humans, lipodystrophy is known to be a similar condition characterized by the loss of adipose tissue with severe hepatic lipid accumulation [30]. Consistent with these observations, the present study has shown that ipragliflozin increased epididymal fat weight in HFD-fed mice, with an inverse correlation between liver and epididymal fat weights. It suggests that ipragliflozin treatment promoted normotopic fat accumulation in the epididymal fat and prevented ectopic fat accumulation in the liver.

In the epididymal fat of ipragliflozin-treated mice, increased adipocyte size and reduced number of CLS were observed. It suggests that ipragliflozin increased the lipid-storage capacity of adipocytes and inhibited adipocyte death followed by macrophage accumulation. Our results are consistent with a recent study using adipocyte-specific inducible phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-knockout mice, which exhibit enhanced insulin signaling in adipocytes. Although PTEN-knockout mice gained more weight and adipose tissue during HFD feeding, they showed enhanced insulin sensitivity, improved hepatic steatosis, and reduced adipose tissue inflammation [31]. Therefore, we consider that ipragliflozin treatment enhanced adipocyte insulin signaling via improving hyperinsulinemia, thereby resulting in increased lipid-storage capacity in adipocytes. Since it has been reported that hyperglycemia causes inflammation and insulin resistance in adipocyte with oxidative stress-dependent manner [32], reducing hyperglycemia by ipragliflozin could additionally contribute to improve insulin resistance and inflammation in adipocytes. Because ipragliflozin treatment caused an elevation in fasting serum NEFA levels in HFD-fed mice, ipragliflozin appeared to enhance lipolysis in adipose tissue. However, the possible increase of lipolysis has a small net effect on adiposity in HFD-induced obese mice; increased lipid-storage capacity in adipocytes by improvement of insulin sensitivity may exceed enhanced lipolysis, resulting in an increase in adiposity.

The present study showed that 4-week ipragliflozin treatment increased plasma glucagon levels in obese mice, which could induce the expression of the gluconeogenic gene Pck1 in the liver. The finding is consistent with previous studies in which SGLT2 inhibitors increased both plasma glucagon and endogenous glucose production in subjects with T2DM [33, 34]. A recent report has demonstrated that SGLT2 is expressed in glucagon-secreting α-cells of the pancreatic islets and that dapagliflozin directly promotes glucagon secretion in human α-cells [35]. Increased plasma glucagon levels possibly due to the direct effect of SGLT2 inhibition on α-cells may offset the glucose-lowering effects of ipragliflozin. In patients with T2DM, glucose-induced suppression of glucagon is impaired, causing hyperglucagonemia and elevated hepatic glucose production [36]. The chronic effects of increased plasma glucagon levels by SGLT2 inhibition in T2DM await further studies.

Although the association with the changes of body weight remains unclear, it has been reported that the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin improves liver dysfunction in patients with T2DM, assessed by serum ALT and γ-GTP levels [37]. In our human study, approximately 20% of patients treated with ipragliflozin did not achieve more than 1% of body weight reduction. Nevertheless, consistent with our animal study, we confirmed that liver dysfunction was improved by ipragliflozin even in patients without noticeable body weight reduction. In humans, a recent study has demonstrated that the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin elicited an adaptive increase of energy intake in patients with T2DM, which caused substantially less weight loss than that expected from the energy dissipated because of glycosuria [12]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that body weight reaches a plateau rather than a sustainable decrease during SGLT2 inhibitors treatment in clinical studies [12, 38]. It is therefore conceivable that ipragliflozin treatment increased energy intake to attenuate body weight reduction in a patient population with a small reduction of body weight. The present clinical study has limitations; lipid accumulation in the liver and adipose tissue were not evaluated by imaging analysis such as ultrasonography or computed tomography. Further studies are required to clarify the changes of lipid accumulation both in the liver and adipose tissue of patients with T2DM during SGLT2 inhibitors treatment.

The reason for significant increase of serum HDL-cholesterol in tertile 2 is unclear. Given that baseline serum HDL-cholesterol levels and frequency of baseline medication of lipid-lowering drugs are the lowest in Tertile 2 among 3 tertiles, we speculate that the ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to increase serum HDL-cholesterol levels [37, 39, 40] clearly emerged in Tertile 2.

Unlike in mice, our clinical study suggests that the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on human body weight vary across individuals. In humans, higher brain function such as thought and action more significantly contribute to feeding behavior than that in mice [41]. It is therefore conceivable that the complex of behavioral, environmental, and physiologic factors could modify the changes of body weight through feeding behavior in humans during treatment of SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, since experimental mice are able to access food all the time under ad libitum feeding, it is likely that elicited appetite by SGLT2 inhibitors directly links to food intake, resulting in increased energy intake.

In conclusion, ipragliflozin improved hepatic steatosis in obese mice and liver dysfunction in patients with T2DM irrespective of body weight reduction. Although ipragliflozin increased energy intake and epididylmal fat mass to attenuate body weight reduction in the obese mice, systemic glucose intolerance and tissue insulin resistance were markedly improved. The present study could provide new insight into the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on hepatic steatosis, and SGLT2 inhibitors can be potentially considered as an optional treatment of T2DM patients with hepatic steatosis."
37,4902150,2016,Vascular health and risk management,SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists as second-line therapy in type 2 diabetes: patient selection and perspectives.,"Second-line pharmacotherapy selection for patients with T2DM optimized on MET, or with intolerance or contraindication to MET, is debated.2 Experts recommend that patient-specific considerations and shared decision-making should be incorporated into treatment decisions.2 GLP-1RA and SGLT2-I are two promising new classes of diabetes pharmacotherapy.

Key considerations for patient selection are outlined in Table 3. Currently, no head-to-head studies evaluating GLP-1RA versus SGLT2-I are available. A review of placebo-controlled trials of GLP-1RA and SGLT2-I in T2DM, with or without baseline MET therapy, suggests that both the classes are likely similar in efficacy, lowering A1c by ~1%–1.5%. GLP-1RA, especially at higher doses, may be slightly more efficacious in terms of glucose lowering and weight loss than SGLT2-I. Most clinical trials evaluated patients with only moderately uncontrolled diabetes (average A1c <9% at baseline), and limited data are available describing the efficacy of these agents in patients with poorer level of control. Some evidence suggests that some patients may be nonrespondent to treatment with GLP-1RA, although the reason for the lack of response is unclear; such patients should have therapy discontinued.63 Both GLP-1RA and SGLT2-I offer minimal risk of hypoglycemia and appear to have positive, although modest, effects on weight and BP. The ELIXA trial identified a neutral CV effect of lixisenatide in patients with T2DM and recent acute coronary syndrome. Conversely, the EMP-REG OUTCOME trial found an exciting reduction in CV outcomes in patients with T2DM and known ASCVD that were treated with empagliflozin. In addition to needing long-term data in primary CV prevention populations, further research evaluating the CV effects of other GLP-1RA and SGLT2-I is required to understand whether such findings are agent or dose dependent. In the meantime, both ELIXA and EMP-REG OUTCOME trials should be accepted as strong evidence supporting the potential role of both GLP-1RA and SGLT2-I in patients with T2DM and known CV diseases.

Practical administration requirements may be important considerations for those with limited dexterity, poor eyesight, or aversion to the use of injectable medications. Patients treated with GLP-1RA will need to self-inject agents or have them administered subcutaneously anywhere from twice daily to once weekly depending on formulation. Learning to self-inject GLP-1RA requires learning to use prefilled pens and steps for reconstitution with diluents. Conversely, SGLT2-I are oral formulations that may be preferred by some patients due to ease of administration. 

As relatively new classes of diabetes medications, GLP-1RA and SGLT2 agents are available as branded products with no generic equivalents. Costs per day are considerable and higher for GLP-1RA than for SGLT2-I (Table 3). However, peer-reviewed published pharmacoeconomic evaluations have generally found that GLP-1RA, specifically exenatide BID and exenatide weekly, are cost-effective when used as second-line treatment relative to analog basal insulins with costs per quality-adjusted life year within the generally accepted range for cost-effectiveness (Table 3).64–67 Investigators found that costs per quality-adjusted life year were dependent on analysis time horizon, baseline body mass index, degree of weight loss, and assumptions on A1c trends over time.67 Peer-reviewed published cost-effectiveness data for SGLT2-I are currently limited, with most data reported for dapagliflozin. Relative to SU or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 therapy, dapagliflozin is estimated to be cost-effective below the generally accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds (Table 3).68,69 

Adverse effects of GLP-1RA include gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), increased heart rate, and injection site reactions. While there is mixed evidence regarding whether GLP-1RA increase risk for acute pancreatitis and they are associated with thyroid tumors in animals, prescribers should consider these possible adverse effects in patients at elevated risk for either outcome. Adverse effects of SGLT2-I include genitourinary infections, a possible association with bladder cancer, DKA, and bone fractures. Patients should be engaged in shared decision-making and discussion about potential benefits and adverse effects with either class prior to initiating therapy. 

Renal function should be assessed before initiating therapy with either GLP-1RA or SGLT2-I. Use of the GLP-1RA exenatide has been associated with cases of acute renal insufficiency or worsening of chronic renal failure.70 Caution is suggested in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, and use is not recommended or contraindicated in patients with a GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Limited data exist regarding the use of other GLP-1RA in patients with renal insufficiency and similar caution is recommended for all GLP-1RA until more data are available. Generally, use of SGLT2-I in patients with GFR less than 45–60 mL/min/1.73 m2 is not recommended or contraindicated, depending on the particular agent. SGLT2-I may be less efficacious and increase the risk of adverse effects. There is a contraindication for all SGLT2-I in patients with GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. 

Patients who have a history of ASCVD, no significant history of recurrent genitourinary infections or bladder cancers, and without risk factors for DKA or fractures may be good candidates for SGLT2-I. Patients able to self-inject, desiring weight loss, and without history of pancreatitis or thyroid tumors may be reasonable candidates for treatment with GLP-1RA. In either case, patients should be closely monitored for both efficacy and adverse effects. Given the expense of both the classes, therapy should be stopped in patients that fail to respond. 

Differences also exist within drug classes. Exenatide and liraglutide have slightly better weight and efficacy outcomes compared to other GLP-1RA. Once-daily or weekly formulations may be preferred by patients and improve adherence. Longer acting agents also tend to have greater effect on fasting blood glucose, whereas shorter acting agents target postprandial glucose. Amongst SGLT2-I, canagliflozin specifically has raised concerns about risk of bone fracture, although it is unclear whether an association exists with other SGLT2-I. Empagliflozin appears to reduce CV risk in patients with known ASCVD, although it has more modest improvements in glycemic control when compared to other SGLT2-I. Further data are needed to understand if the reduction in CV outcomes with empagliflozin is a class effect."
40,5327537,2017,Cardiovascular diabetology,"Effects of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, on blood pressure and markers of arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a post hoc analysis.","In the post hoc analysis of pooled data from four Phase 3 studies, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg provided reductions in SBP and DBP, as well as pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, and double product compared with placebo over 26 weeks in a broad population of patients with T2DM. Responses were generally similar in the post hoc analysis of data from a smaller, 6-week ABPM study in patients with T2DM and hypertension. Both canagliflozin doses reduced mean 24-h SBP and DBP over 6 weeks compared with placebo. Canagliflozin 300 mg provided reductions in pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure compared with placebo, while canagliflozin 100 mg had more modest effects on these parameters. In both study populations, canagliflozin was generally well tolerated, with an increase in AEs related to the mechanism of SGLT2 inhibition (e.g., osmotic diuresis–related AEs), consistent with previous Phase 3 studies of canagliflozin [15].

The findings from this analysis are consistent with those reported for the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in a study that evaluated changes in BP and markers of arterial stiffness and vascular resistance in patients with T2DM [23]. Empagliflozin provided significant reductions in SBP and DBP, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, and double product in a post hoc analysis of pooled 24-week data from four Phase 3 studies in patients with T2DM. Similar improvements were seen in a post hoc analysis of data from a 12-week ABPM study of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM and hypertension [23]. Collectively, the results from the canagliflozin and empagliflozin studies suggest that improvements in arterial stiffness and vascular resistance may be class effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. Results from the current analysis demonstrated a reduction in BP and associated parameters within 6 weeks of initiating canagliflozin that persisted through 26 weeks of treatment. Earlier responses on BP with other SGLT2 inhibitors have not been well characterized, but in the canagliflozin ABPM study, small numeric improvements in 24-h SBP were noted after 1 day of treatment. Of note, canagliflozin has been shown to provide a reduction in plasma volume within 1 week due to increased UGE and natriuresis, which may contribute to initial BP lowering in patients with T2DM [24].

The favorable effects of canagliflozin treatment on pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, and double product are expected to translate into reduced arterial stiffness, improved blood flow, and a lower cardiac workload. Furthermore, as these markers have been shown to be predictive of cardiovascular events [8, 9, 25–27], the improvements in BP seen with canagliflozin treatment, in addition to reductions in HbA1c and body weight, may contribute to better cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin showed a significant reduction in the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure compared with placebo in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease [28]. It is not yet known whether the improved cardiovascular outcomes observed with empagliflozin apply to the entire SGLT2 inhibitor class, but recent meta-analyses support favorable cardiovascular outcomes with SGLT2 inhibitors [29–34]. It has been hypothesized that the increase in osmotic diuresis associated with SGLT2 inhibition results in a lower BP and intravascular volume that may help reduce cardiac workload [35, 36]; however, further studies are needed to define the cardioprotective mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibition. Results from the ongoing CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01032629 [37]) and CANVAS-R (renal endpoints; NCT01989754 [38]) trials in patients with a history or high risk for cardiovascular disease are expected in 2017 and will help determine whether the improvements in cardiovascular outcomes seen with empagliflozin are representative of the SGLT2 inhibitor class.

Limitations of the study include the post hoc nature of the analysis and the relatively small number of patients in the ABPM study population. In addition, double product may be best assessed using ABPM and many not accurately predict cardiovascular risk in some patient populations [39]. However, the use of various measures in two different studies showing concordant results in two different study populations representing a broad range of patients with T2DM, including those with hypertension, strengthens the analysis."
41,5389095,2017,Cardiovascular diabetology,Rationale and design of a multicenter placebo-controlled double-blind randomized trial to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on endothelial function: the EMBLEM trial.,"The EMBLEM trial is an ongoing, prospective, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, investigator-initiated clinical trial aiming to assess the effect of empagliflozin on endothelial function in patients with T2DM and established CVD. We hypothesized that empagliflozin can improve endothelial function and thereby ameliorate other vascular markers such as arterial stiffness and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in this patient population (Fig. 2). The primary endpoint is the baseline to 24 weeks change in the RH-PAT-derived RHI, a surrogate marker for endothelial function. In addition, other CV markers, such as arterial stiffness and SNS activity, will be also examined as secondary endpoints as will the potential for a mechanistic association between the changes in such markers by empagliflozin treatment. Thus, this trial has the potential to provide novel clinical evidence on the effect of empagliflozin on vascular function and may help to explain the results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [10]. A growing body of evidence suggests that the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on CV pathways beyond glucose-lowering actions are multifactorial, possibly resulting in improved CV outcomes [41]. SGLT2 inhibitors are known to not only attenuate glycemic toxicity independent of insulin, but also to reduce BP, BW, and visceral fat via metabolic and hemodynamic pathways [13–16, 42]. These pharmacological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are likely to contribute to the improvement of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity [43–45]. Given the potential for these favorable actions, treatment effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on vascular function and atherosclerosis are highly expected. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors has already been shown to significantly reduce BP via the modification of markers of arterial stiffness and vascular resistance [46, 47]. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors can potentially reduce SNS activity that is augmented in part due to hyperglycemia [41, 48], although empagliflozin did not affect SNS activity in younger patients with type 1 diabetes [46]. More recently, some experimental studies showed that SGLT2 treatment could improve circadian rhythm and lability of BP, indicating a possible major cardioprotective role for this class of drugs [49–51]. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin treatment has elicited marked risk reduction for CV mortality and hospitalization as a result of worsening heart failure in patients with T2DM and established CVD [10]. In contrast, no significant reduction in individual macrovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, was observed in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial or in a subsequent meta-analysis of data from clinical trials [52]. However, because the duration of the trials included in the meta-analysis may be too short to properly evaluate the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in relation to macrovascular events, it may therefore be plausible to investigate the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on surrogate markers related to vascular function and architecture.

Recent animal studies have demonstrated that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce oxidative stress and the inflammation processes that are closely associated with and essential to the genesis of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis [53–55]. Some recent preclinical animal studies provide evidence of SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated mitigation of endothelial dysfunction and/or atherosclerosis. Salim et al. [56] reported that ipragliflozin prevented the development of endothelial dysfunction, partly via the attenuation of oxidative stress in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Nakajima et al. [57] found that ipragliflozin treatment prevented progression of aortic atherosclerosis and improved the survival rate in Apo E-deficient mice. Terasaki et al. [58] also demonstrated that dapagliflozin or ipragliflozin treatment reduced aortic atherosclerotic lesions, accompanied by suppression of macrophage foam cell formation, in diabetic Apo E-deficient and db/db mice. More recently, Han et al. [59] revealed that empagliflozin-mediated attenuation of aortic atheroma volume in Apo E-deficient mice was associated with reduced insulin resistance, a reduction in the levels of inflammatory markers, and increased adiponectin. These results provide strong evidence to suggest the possibility that SGLT2 inhibitor effects are potent enough to exert vascular protective effects in clinical settings; however, little evidence currently exists to show the clinical effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on vascular function and atherosclerosis in patients with T2DM. Some randomized clinical trials designed to assess the anti-atherosclerotic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors by measuring carotid intima-media thickness are currently underway [60, 61].

In the present trial, we focused on vascular endothelial function which has a pivotal role in the regulation of vascular tone and circulation which itself is governed by the interplay of vasoconstrictive and vasodilative factors. Endothelial function can be impaired by various metabolic disturbances and is closely associated with increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance [62, 63]. Hence, endothelial dysfunction is paramount to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and is considered to be an important marker predictive of the future risk of CV events [64–66]. To make matters worse, evidence has accumulated to suggest that endothelial dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of T2DM through common pathological pathways described previously, synergistically resulting in a higher risk of diabetes-related vascular complications [67–69]. Given these pathophysiological associations, it is imperative to evaluate the therapeutic effect of glucose-lowering agents on endothelial dysfunction in patients with T2DM [30–32, 70]. The existing animal and human data suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors have favorable effects on several biomarkers related to arterial stiffness, myocardial workload, and SNS activity [47, 51, 71, 72], we seek to address whether empagliflozin modulates endothelial function dependently or independently of such markers as secondary endpoints in the trial proposed herein.

The assessment of endothelial function are clinically of importance to obtain the patients’ CV risk or prognosis, and to evaluate the effect of treatment [73, 74]. A number of reports show that T2DM was associated with abnormal endothelial function on the basis of various physiological functional tests, including RH-PAT [75–78]. Moreover, short-term treatment of some DPP-4 inhibitors improved RHI in patients with T2DM [30, 32], in contrast to large-scale outcome trials with DPP-4 inhibitors that failed to demonstrate superior CV safety compared with a placebo [38–40]. Although the reasons for this discrepancy are not yet fully understood, RH-PAT-guided assessments of endothelial function would make a promising tool for the evaluation of drug efficacy. Because treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors can favorably regulate hemodynamic aspects besides those influenced by glucose and lipid metabolism [13–17], it is highly likely that SGLT2 inhibitors impart a more direct and protective effect on the vascular system.

This trial has several limitations. First, it includes a relatively small sample size. Second, although the RH-PAT test is noninvasive, easy to perform, and an operator-independent method, its measurement is prone to be affected by individual physical conditions, intravascular volume, and the examination room environment. To minimize any such influences at participating institutions, investigators must perform the test in accordance with the EMBLEM-style operation manual which is modified from the manufacturer’s instruction (Additional file 4). In addition, because the empirical prediction implies that changes in the RHI in response to treatment may differ according to the RHI level, we plan to analyze data using subgroups stratified by the RHI level at baseline, as a subgroup analysis. Finally, SGLT2 inhibitors can potentially trigger some characteristic adverse drug reactions, such as intravascular volume depletion and urinary tract and genital infections, especially in the elderly and women [79]. Hence, investigators are cautioned to monitor patients for such reactions throughout the trial. In addition, information will be collected on predefined AESI as described earlier.

In summary, with the recent accumulation of evidence suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors have CV and renal protective effects beyond glucose-lowering, the clinical use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and established CVD could gain increased momentum.

Therefore, further assessments of the mechanisms that underpin the functionality of SGLT2 inhibitors are certainly warranted. The EMBLEM trial is the first study to assess the effect of empagliflozin on endothelial function in patients with T2DM and established CVD. In addition, possible mechanisms driving empagliflozin-mediated interactions between endothelial function and other CV markers will be evaluated. This trial has the potential to reveal profound mechanisms of action by which empagliflozin protects the CV system and improves CV outcomes in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial."
44,5549715,2017,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,Therapeutic Effect of Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter 2 Inhibitor Dapagliflozin on Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"Highly selective inhibitors of the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) are showing promise as useful agents adding to the current therapeutic options in type 2 diabetes mellitus [17]. Dapagliflozin is the first SGLT2 inhibitor demonstrated to clearly reduce hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in clinical therapy [18,19]. SGLT2 gene expression profiling demonstrated ubiquitous distribution in kidney, colon, and liver [20]. Therefore, it is critical to better understand whether renal cell carcinoma has a relationship with SGLT2. qRT-PCR and Western blot assay showed that the relative mRNA and protein SGLT2 in renal cell carcinoma were higher than in normal renal cells (Figure 1A, 1B). 

However, the function of dapagliflozin in renal cell carcinoma remains unclear. Dapagliflozin is new therapeutic class in the marketplace. We observed that dapagliflozin shows a cytotoxic effect on human renal cell carcinoma, and exhibits hypotoxicity to normal human renal cells in culture (Figure 2A, 2D). In the current study, we also found that dapagliflozin regulated cell cycle and apoptosis in CaKi-1 cells (Figure 3). These results suggest that dapagliflozin is involved in the regulation of the malignant behavior of CaKi-1 cells. 

Glucose plays an important role in maintaining the energy metabolism of tumor cells, promoting new angiogenesis, tumor proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis [21,22]. To investigate this further, the effects of dapagliflozin on glucose uptake were evaluated. Figure 4D shows dapagliflozin reduced the glucose uptake in CaKi-1 cells in dose-dependent manners. We also found decreased expression of SGLT2 in the group with dapagliflozin treatment (Figure 4A–4C), which suggests that dapagliflozin can inhibit the protein expression of SGLT2 associated with glucose metabolism. All these results suggest that dapagliflozin can decrease the malignant behavior of CaKi-1 cells via down-regulating SGLT2. The in vivo experiment also indicated that the nude mice with dapagliflozin treatment produced significantly smaller tumors and reduced SGLT2 expression (Figure 5A–5F). These data suggest dapagliflozin functions as a tumor suppressor in renal carcinoma. In the dapagliflozin-treated mice, we found dapagliflozin caused a significant increase in tumor necrosis and a less weakly positive expression of SGLT2 (Figure 5G, 5H), suggesting that dapagliflozin may have an effect on tumor necrosis."
45,5024052,2015,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on long-term efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal impairment: results of the long-term ASP1941 safety evaluation in patients with type 2 diabetes with renal impairment (LANTERN) study.","In the present study, treatment with ipragliflozin for 24 weeks was associated with significantly greater improvements in glycaemic control and body weight in the ipragliflozin group than in the placebo group in the overall cohort, and in patients with mild RI. In patients with moderate RI, the improvements in glycaemic control were not significantly greater in the ipragliflozin group than in the placebo group. The improvements in glycaemic control in patients with mild RI and the reduction in body weight in patients with mild or moderate RI were apparent by week 4 of treatment and were maintained at week 52. 

The mean changes in HbA1c and FPG from baseline to week 24 in the ipragliflozin group in the present study were smaller than those observed in earlier studies of ipragliflozin [HbA1c: −0.64 to −0.87%; FPG: −1.23 mmol/l (−22.2 mg/dl) to −2.30 mmol/l (−41.4 mg/dl)] 12, 13, 14 that enrolled patients with normal serum creatinine levels. When analysed according to the severity of renal dysfunction, the reductions in HbA1c and FPG levels were smaller in patients with moderate RI than in patients with mild RI. The same tendency was observed for the changes in HbA1c and FPG from baseline to week 52. RI was also associated with less efficient reductions in HbA1c and FPG in studies on canagliflozin 15 and dapagliflozin 16 in Western populations. There are several possible explanations for this. First, because the mean HbA1c level at baseline was lower in the present study than in the earlier studies (7.52 vs. 8.24–8.38%) 12, 14, the capacity for a reduction in HbA1c level was lower in the present study relative to the earlier ipragliflozin studies. Second, glomerular filtration of glucose is essential for the clinical effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. The patients enrolled in the present study had mild to moderate renal dysfunction, which might contribute to inefficient urinary glucose excretion and a smaller reduction in HbA1c. This was confirmed in the present study because the reduction in HbA1c was smaller in patients with moderate RI than in patients with mild RI. This is consistent with the results of an earlier study in which ipragliflozin‐induced glycosuria declined with decreasing eGFR 17. The study by Ferrannini et al. 17 also showed that there was no appreciable difference in glucose excretion between Japanese patients with mild RI or those who had normal kidney functions. 

Although the blood glucose‐lowering effects of ipragliflozin were influenced by RI, the reduction in body weight from baseline to week 24 was consistently greater in the ipragliflozin group than in the placebo group, with adjusted mean differences of −1.61 kg in patients with mild RI and −1.92 kg in patients with moderate RI. If urinary glucose excretion and urinary excretion of energy decrease with increasing RI severity, we would expect a smaller reduction in body weight during treatment with ipragliflozin in patients with moderate RI compared with patients with mild RI; however, this was not the case. In fact, the mean reduction in body weight was slightly greater in patients with moderate RI than in patients with mild RI in the present study. Although the reason for which reduced renal function did not influence the reduction in body weight during treatment with ipragliflozin is not clear, similar findings were also reported for canagliflozin 15 and dapagliflozin 16. It must be acknowledged that the present study involved relatively small numbers of patients with moderate RI; therefore, further studies are needed to determine the potential underlying mechanisms. 

The safety profile of ipragliflozin in the present study was generally similar to that in other studies 7, 12, 14, 18. The most common TEAEs in the present study, including nasopharyngitis and polyuria/pollakiuria, were also found in other studies, and the incidence of these events was not increased in patients with mild or moderate RI. Furthermore, the incidence rates of TEAEs of special interest, including hypoglycaemia, genital infections and urinary tract infections, were very low in the ipragliflozin group and were not affected by RI. Although the incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the ipragliflozin group, the incidence of adverse events related to hypoglycaemia may increase when ipragliflozin is used in combination with a sulfonylurea; therefore, ipragliflozin should be administered carefully, with consideration for the risk of hypoglycaemia when administered concomitantly with a sulfonylurea. 

Treatment with ipragliflozin was also associated with a reduction in blood pressure at week 24, which was maintained at week 52. Although the change was small, it may be clinically relevant in patients with renal dysfunction. 

In the ipragliflozin group, eGFR showed a transient reduction at week 2, irrespective of RI severity, but recovered to baseline levels by week 24. Meanwhile, cystatin C levels increased slightly in the ipragliflozin group compared with placebo, but no significant changes from baseline in urinary N‐acetyl‐β‐d‐glucosaminidase levels occurred in either group. Renal function, therefore, was not appreciably affected by ipragliflozin in these patients. Urinary volume was reported to increase slightly during treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors 19, 20, probably because of the osmotic potential of glucose in urine. This increase in urine volume is associated with osmotic diuresis and a mild decrease in body fluid, reflecting an increase in haematocrit and causing a transient reduction in eGFR; however, we found slight increases in the level of urine β2‐microglobulin, which is normally freely filtered at the glomerulus and then reabsorbed by renal tubules. The serum and urinary phosphate and magnesium levels were higher in the ipragliflozin group than in the placebo group. The severity of RI did not obviously affect the levels of serum or urinary electrolytes. The mechanisms underlying the increased serum levels of these electrolytes are unclear, but increases in these urinary electrolytes might be attributable to slight increases in their serum levels or altered fluid handling. Similar results have been reported for other SGLT2 inhibitors 19, 21, 22. 

Some limitations of the present study should be noted, including the relatively small number of patients enrolled in each treatment group and the short duration of treatment (1 year). 

In conclusion, ipragliflozin improved glycaemic control and reduced body weight in Japanese patients with T2DM with mild to moderate RI, and its blood glucose‐lowering effects were positively correlated with renal function. There were no clinically significant safety concerns in patients with RI and the safety profiles were similar in patients with mild or moderate RI. Taken together, these results confirm that ipragliflozin is a valid treatment option for patients with T2DM with normal renal function or mild RI, but not for patients with T2DM with moderate RI."
48,6220780,2018,Clinical pharmacology in drug development,"Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Luseogliflozin, a Selective SGLT2 Inhibitor, in Japanese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes With Mild to Severe Renal Impairment.","One of the greatest challenges in the treatment of patients with diabetes is the limited availability of suitable glucose‐lowering agents for patients with comorbid chronic kidney disease. In addition, patients with diabetes may develop diabetic nephropathy in the long term. Therefore, effective treatment options are needed for diabetic patients with renal impairment, with a particular emphasis on the effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antidiabetic drugs in T2DM patients. 

In this study, we investigated the effects of mild to severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of luseogliflozin in Japanese T2DM patients. The values for Cmax, AUClast, AUCinf, and tmax of luseogliflozin were similar in patients across all renal function groups. On the other hand, the half‐life (t1/2) tended to be prolonged in the G4 group; this tendency in patients with severe renal impairment could be a result of the slight lowering of urinary excretion in addition to metabolic enzyme activity in the kidneys (including CYP3A5, CYP4A11, CYP4F2, and CYP4F3B). However, for all other parameters, no differences were observed between patients with normal renal function and those with impaired renal function. Consequently, it appears that renal impairment has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of luseogliflozin. 

In terms of the pharmacokinetics of the metabolites M1, M2, M3, and M17, Cmax tended to be higher, AUClast and AUCinf tended to increase, and t1/2 and tmax tended to be prolonged in the lower eGFR groups. However, because the plasma concentrations of the metabolites were much lower than those of luseogliflozin, renal impairment was thought to have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of luseogliflozin. In contrast, the AUCs of other SGLT2 inhibitors have been reported to increase in patients with renal impairment, particularly in those with severe impairment.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 This characteristic appears to be because of the decreased renal excretion of SGLT2 inhibitors as well as reduced metabolic enzyme activity in the kidneys resulting from decreased renal function. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic profiles of luseogliflozin are unaffected even in patients with renal impairment. Moreover, in addition to metabolism by CYPs in the kidney, luseogliflozin is also metabolized by CYP3A4/5 and UGT1A1 in the liver; this pathway may play a role in luseogliflozin's stable pharmacokinetic profile despite the presence of renal impairment. 

With regard to the pharmacodynamic profile of luseogliflozin, 24‐hour UGE values increased in all groups compared with baseline. The degree of increase was smaller in the lower eGFR groups, and the extent of change in UGE decreased in the lower eGFR groups relative to G1 (those with baseline eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2). In patients with renal impairment, the filtration capacity for glucose in the kidney decreases, and therefore, the inhibitory action of glucose reabsorption by luseogliflozin appeared to decline. In addition, the amount of filtration of luseogliflozin itself is thought to decline in patients with renal impairment. Because SGLT2 inhibitors appear to act from the luminal side of the renal tubule,20 the effect of luseogliflozin is thought to be attenuated. 

With respect to plasma glucose AUC, decreases from the day before administration tended to be smaller in the lower eGFR groups, and decreases in G3b (eGFR, 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m2) 0‐4 hours after administration were smaller than those in G1 (eGFR, ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2). In addition, decreases in glucose AUC were smaller in G4 than in G1. This is thought to be from attenuation of the effect of the drug in patients with renal impairment, as discussed above. We also found a positive correlation between FPG and UGE, with smaller UGE increases in the lower eGFR groups compared with the G1 group. 

These results are consistent with those reported for other SGLT2 inhibitors.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 As described above, in all groups, UGE increased and plasma glucose decreased after administration of 5 mg luseogliflozin, with the magnitude of the change decreasing with decreasing eGFR levels. 

In this study, 12 AEs occurred in 8 of the 57 patients; however, all were of mild to moderate severity, and no severe AEs were observed. Although some patients had renal impairment, no AEs related to the renal and urinary systems were observed. In addition, no tendencies toward increased incidence rates of AEs or increases in specific AEs in the lower eGFR groups were observed. No deaths or serious AEs were observed in any group. 

There were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters or vital signs during the study. Taken together, the results demonstrate no clinically relevant issues related to the safety of luseogliflozin regardless of the degree of renal impairment."
50,5963148,2018,Cardiovascular diabetology,Effect of canagliflozin on left ventricular diastolic function in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"This is the first prospective study of the effects of canagliflozin on left ventricular diastolic function in patients with T2DM who were at high risk of a cardiovascular event. Furthermore, among various parameters that changed through the administration of canagliflozin, only ΔHb significantly correlated with the Δseptal E/e′ ratio. Multiple regression analysis also revealed that ΔHb was an independent predictive factor for the Δseptal E/e′ ratio. On the other hand, canagliflozin caused no exacerbation of autonomic function as assessed by BRS and frequency domain analysis of HRV. 

SGLT2 inhibitors were reported to increase Hb, and the involvement of erythropoietin in the mechanism for this increase was reported [24–26]. Inhibited reabsorption of glucose from the proximal tubule was suggested to reduce oxygen consumption in proximal tubule cells, accelerate the recovery of erythropoietin production from interstitial fibroblasts, and thus cause increases in Hb [25, 27]. Reports showed that erythropoietin had cardioprotective effects [28–31] and that left ventricular diastolic function was improved in patients whose Hb was increased by an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent [32, 33]. In addition, increases in Hb improve the oxygen supply to tissues, which also results in improved left ventricular diastolic function [34, 35]. Another important mechanism for the increased Hb values is a reduction in plasma volume due to osmotic diuresis and the natriuretic effect [26, 36]. Chronic expanded plasma volume is known to increase the burden on the myocardium and trigger cardiac disorders. In patients having heart or renal failure, including those with concomitant diabetes, increases in Hb through decreased plasma volume were reported to correlate with improved mortality [37, 38]. As SGLT2 inhibitors have been considered to reduce the cardiac workload by decreasing plasma volume [39, 40], in the present study, decreased plasma volume may have reduced the preload and afterload, resulting in improved left ventricular diastolic function. Such improvement might also be attributed to the simultaneous effects of decreased BP [41], reduced body weight, less visceral fat [42, 43], and improvements in endothelial dysfunction [44, 45], systemic micro-inflammation [43], cardiac injury [46], left ventricular hypertrophy, etc. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanism for the improved left ventricular diastolic function resulting from the administration of an SGLT2 inhibitor. 

Reductions in BP and plasma volume by an SGLT2 inhibitor diminish the cardiac load, but these agents could possibly have the adverse effect of enhancing sympathetic nervous system activity. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity has important roles in the feedback mechanism of lowered BP and reduced plasma volume; but over the long term, it is known to cause increases in heart load due to an elevated HR and fluid retention and thus becomes a factor in left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Loop diuretics used for heart failure patients are known to increase sympathetic nervous system activity by reducing plasma volume and thus to adversely affect the long-term outcome [47]. In this study, canagliflozin did not exacerbate the autonomic function assessed by BRS and frequency domain analysis of HRV. As an SGLT2 inhibitor was reported to improve BRS in an animal study [48], research on the effects of long-term administration of SGLT2 inhibitors on autonomic function are awaited. 

In our subgroup analysis, the improvement in left ventricular diastolic function was significantly greater in those who took sulfonylurea before the start of the study and continued thereafter than in those not given this agent. As sulfonylurea was reported to be involved in left ventricular diastolic dysfunction [11] and has attenuated cardioprotective effects [49], it is possible that canagliflozin compensated for the dysfunction caused by the administration of sulfonylurea while reducing the load on the heart. Furthermore, our study patients who were provided with a DPP-4 inhibitor had a significantly greater improvement in their left ventricular diastolic function than those not provided with this drug. A DPP-4 inhibitor is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent that has many advantages, such as an antiarteriosclerotic effect [50] and vascular endothelial function-improving effect [51], but increased hospitalizations due to heart failure have been noted [15]. We found that combination therapy of a DPP-4 inhibitor with the SGLT2 inhibitor improved left ventricular diastolic function possibly because the SGLT2 inhibitor compensated for some of the concerns regarding DPP-4 inhibitors. In this study, a significant correlation (r = − 0.464, p = 0.004) was observed between age and improvement in left ventricular diastolic function. Patients administered sulfonylurea (p = 0.025) or a DPP-4 inhibitor (p = 0.004) were significantly older than those with whom they were compared; thus the results possibly reflect these differences. 

Recently, although empagliflozin was reported to have improved left ventricular diastolic function in patients with T2DM with a history of CVD [52], this is the first report showing the possibility of canagliflozin improving left ventricular diastolic function in patients with T2DM who were mainly grouped according to primary prevention. As the sub-analysis in the CANVAS trial showed a similar inhibitory effect on heart failure-associated hospitalizations between the primary and secondary prevention participants [19] and canagliflozin significantly suppressed such hospitalizations compared to a DPP-4 inhibitor and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist [53], it is possible that improvement in left ventricular diastolic function was involved in those results. Also, a recent sub-analysis in the EMPA-REG trial indicated that Hb increases were involved in suppression of cardiovascular events independently of lowered plasma glucose and decreased BP, suggesting the involvement of improved left ventricular diastolic function via rises in Hb [54]. 

The incidence of heart failure, particularly heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) for which diastolic dysfunction is a major cause, is rapidly increasing globally with aging of the population [55, 56]. Thus establishment of therapy for such conditions is imperative. However, the outcome of HFpEF cannot be improved even with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, beta blocker, or aldosterone antagonist [57–60], all of which are effective for improving the outcome in heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [61]. A possible reason may be that HFpEF develops due to multiple factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and renal dysfunction; optimal treatment of these diseases is likely important in improving left ventricular diastolic function and outcome in HFpEF patients. An SGLT2 inhibitor is likely to be a promising drug in the prevention of HFpEF and improving the outcome of HFpEF by improving left ventricular diastolic function in patients with T2DM. In addition, our results suggested that increases in Hb are involved in improved left ventricular diastolic function and can be used as a predictive marker of such improvement. 

This study has three limitations. First, although this was a prospective study, the number of study patients was small and this was uncontrolled observational study. Therefore, larger randomized controlled trials are needed. Second, we could not verify whether the improvement in diastolic function was solely attributable to canagliflozin. Finally, the relationship between the administration of canagliflozin and cardiovascular events could not be verified due to the short research period."
51,6282986,2018,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","Persistence of oral antidiabetic treatment for type 2 diabetes characterized by drug class, patient characteristics and severity of renal impairment: A Japanese database analysis.","The results of the present retrospective, real‐world database analysis show that, among the OADs evaluated, DPP‐4 inhibitors and BGs were the most frequently prescribed OAD classes, with the longest treatment persistence. These findings are similar to those from previous reports in Japan.6, 19, 20 TZDs and glinides were the least frequently prescribed OADs, and treatment persistence was shortest for α‐GIs and SUs. We believe treatment persistence is a result of several factors, including a balance of effectiveness, tolerability, safety, superior utility and cost. Specifically, the increased risk of hypoglycaemia associated with SUs5, 21 and reduced quality of life linked to α‐GIs in comparison with DPP‐4 inhibitors13, 22 may have been related to the poor persistence observed for these OADs. 

When treatment persistence was evaluated by severity of RI at the index date, persistence was shortest in patients at RI stage G4+ and varied for each OAD drug class by the RI stage. The longest persistence was observed with DPP‐4 inhibitors across all RI stages (G1‐G4+), followed by BGs at stages G1 and G2, and subsequently by glinides across all stages (G1‐G4+). The number of index dates for BGs (208), SUs (67) and TZDs (43) was lowest for RI stage G4+, suggesting that OADs are generally prescribed properly by physicians, in accordance with the Guidelines for the Treatment of Diabetes in Japan.5 

Considering patient baseline characteristics, the increasing severity of RI was consistent with ageing and higher rates of comorbidities.23, 24 The younger average age of patients at RI stage G1 could explain why persistence appears lower than for those at stage G2 in our analysis15; however, in general, treatment persistence rates declined with increasing severity of RI. This could be attributed to switching to other drugs without prescription restrictions in patients with increasing severity of RI, a reduced requirement for OADs because of a decline in blood sugar, and an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.25 Although we observed similar (but longer) persistence for DPP‐4 inhibitors and BGs compared with other OAD classes at RI stages G1 and G2, a longer persistence was observed for DPP‐4 inhibitors than for BGs at RI stages G3 and G4+. 

Evaluation of prescribing patterns showed that no concomitant OADs were prescribed with DPP‐4 inhibitors 55% of the time at the index date, suggesting that DPP‐4 inhibitors were most frequently prescribed as first‐line monotherapy. This observation is consistent with a study concluding that DPP‐4 inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed OAD class during the last decade in Japan.6 In the present study, BGs—which are widely endorsed as first‐line treatment in Western countries26, 27—were used in younger patients with relatively stable renal function (G3, 24%; G4+, 2%). BGs such as metformin are contraindicated in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and their use should be avoided in patients with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 according to the Japan Diabetes Society28 and the US Food and Drug Administration.29 Patients who were prescribed SUs had better renal function despite their older age, suggesting that patients who had previously been prescribed SUs switched to glinides when their renal function declined. Similarly, α‐GIs were prescribed to patients who were older, had reduced renal function, and more comorbidities. Many patients who were prescribed glinides at the index date had concomitant treatments, implying a tendency to prescribe this OAD class for patients with poor blood sugar control.30 Notably, 19% of patients prescribed BGs and TZDs had comorbid heart failure despite contraindications.5 

Within the class of DPP‐4 inhibitors, linagliptin was preferentially prescribed for patients at RI stage G4+ and for those who were older, had higher complication rates, and concomitant insulin use. Among patients prescribed other DPP‐4 inhibitors at the index date, differences in baseline characteristics were negligible, indicating the potential for interchangeability of DPP‐4 inhibitors in the sample. Further, more patients who were prescribed linagliptin as first‐line treatment had baseline cardiac, renal and urinary disorders, an observation that was also reported in a previous post‐marketing surveillance study.31 Linagliptin is excreted via the biliary route rather than the renal route like other DPP‐4 inhibitors; therefore, it can be prescribed regardless of RI stage.32 Teneligliptin, which has the second highest rate of biliary excretion (34%),33 was also frequently prescribed in patients with RI stage G4+. Notably, teneligliptin‐treated patients had higher average eGFRs than linagliptin‐treated patients. 

For patients with DPP‐4 inhibitor prescriptions at the index date, previous treatment with other DPP‐4 inhibitors was common (15%‐42%) except for sitagliptin (6%), which was the first DPP‐4 inhibitor launched in Japan in December 2009. A high rate of previous treatment with other DPP‐4 inhibitors was observed for drugs that were launched later. 

Since prescription of DPP‐4 inhibitors has increased rapidly in Japan, the study period is likely to impact this type of real‐world data analysis. Tanabe et al14 reported that DPP‐4 inhibitors were stopped for 2 years in ~80% of cases in a study using the same database (2008‐2013) in 7108 patients with T2DM. Although those data cannot be compared with our results because of differences in data analysis methods, it might be worth noting that DPP‐4 inhibitors became available in Japan in December 2009 with a 2‐week prescription limitation until December 2010, indicating that only a limited number of patients could have been assessed for 2 years until the end of their study period in March 2013. 

The present study has several strengths, including its real‐world setting, the data evaluation from a recognized, large database covering 300 Japanese hospitals providing care for acute‐phase diseases to >20 million patients,34 and a distribution of age of patients with T2DM similar to national patient statistics provided by the statistics bureau of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.2 Some limitations are also worth noting. The treatment persistence observed in this study might be underestimated, as persistence could only be measured within the same hospital in the database and patients who changed hospitals were not followed up. Factors affecting treatment persistence, such as changes in biometric values (e.g. body weight), reasons for starting or terminating a treatment, duration of diabetes, social background, and compliance with diet, exercise and drug treatment could not be evaluated given the lack of these data in the study database. Furthermore, the results of the sensitivity analysis showed an extension in persistence with a prescription gap of ≥60 days vs ≥30 days; this indicates continuation of treatment beyond the prescribed days of supply, possibly because of poor adherence and consequent leftover tablets, which we did not consider. Because the relative persistence between OAD classes was maintained in the sensitivity analysis, we considered our comparisons of treatment persistence to be valid. Data from Diagnosis Procedure Combination hospitals included patients with multiple moderate‐to‐severe diseases and may not reflect the general patient population with T2DM in Japan, resulting in limited generalizability. Additionally, the 6‐month look‐back period may have enabled time for patients to be evaluated for other diseases, leading to higher rates of comorbidities, especially myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke, than those in previous reports.35, 36 Differences between patient characteristics among the OAD classes were not adjusted for using propensity‐score matching; however, stratification by baseline renal function was applied for persistence analysis. Our results reflect the treatment status of patients mostly at RI stages G2 to G4+, including those without serum creatinine values categorized by comorbidity. Factors affecting treatment persistence, such as changes in biometric values (e.g. body weight), reasons for starting or terminating a treatment, duration of diabetes, social background and compliance with diet, exercise and drug treatment, could not be evaluated given the source of data. Patients with available serum creatinine data to calculate eGFR were limited; consequently, analyses based on RI included fewer data points than the other analyses. Also, the durability/persistence of each drug or drug combination as first‐ and second‐line therapy was not evaluated. The post‐discontinuation treatment pattern was also not evaluated. Finally, DPP‐4 inhibitors are widely used in Japan37; however, their use may be restricted in other countries. This might be partly attributable to differences in approach while formulating treatment guidelines,38 the health insurance reimbursement system, as well as differences in diabetes pathophysiology.39, 40 

Nevertheless, the results reflect a long‐term, real‐world scenario in a large number of patients from numerous centres and provide a comprehensive description of the characteristics of present treatment with OADs in Japanese patients with T2DM. 

Overall, DPP‐4 inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed OAD class, accounting for half of the index dates, followed by BGs, SUs, α‐GIs, glinides and TZDs. Treatment persistence was longest for DPP‐4 inhibitors and BGs. Notably, persistence was highest with DPP‐4 inhibitors in patients with severely decreased renal function. Most OADs were prescribed appropriately by practitioners in Japan; however, contrary to recommendations, BGs were prescribed for patients at RI stage G3 and G4, and SUs and TZDs for patients at stage G4. We believe that the appropriate use of OADs can be improved to achieve the goals of long‐term, effective treatment of patients with T2DM. An open question is whether the higher persistence seen for certain classes was associated with improvements in health outcomes."
52,6067400,2018,BMJ open,Changing use of antidiabetic drugs in the UK: trends in prescribing 2000-2017.,"Our results show that prescribing of metformin has increased and prescribing of SUs has fallen at drug initiation for T2DM between 2000 and 2017, and shows increasing accordance with recommendations from national and international guidelines. In patients with an eGFR ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2 the most commonly prescribed initiation drug class was SUs until 2015, but since then DPP4is are more commonly prescribed. Of note, we found that approximately 1 in 10 people are prescribed metformin despite an eGFR ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prescribing patterns at the first stage of drug therapy intensification have also changed, with prescribing of SUs and TZDs falling, while that of newer drug classes has risen. By 2017, the most commonly prescribed addition to metformin was a DPP4i. Prescribing practice differs by country within the UK. We identified large differences in prescribing practice between countries in the UK, with Northern Ireland and Wales prescribing both DPP4is and SGLT2is more commonly than in England or Scotland. We also show large variations in prescribing practice between CCGs. 

Our large study uses data from a source of population representative primary care records from across the UK to provide great insight into real-world clinical practice from 2000 to 2017. We have attempted to improve direct comparability by developing cohorts that reflect distinct stages of the management of patients with T2DM, rather than examining total prescribing. We have been able to characterise renal function prior to drug initiation for the majority of patients to explore changing concordance with prescribing recommendations. 

However, there are limitations to this analysis. We do not know if the prescribing was initiated in primary or secondary care. In the absence of wider demographic features about the CCGs such as age, socioeconomic status or ethnicity distributions we cannot explore factors that might drive variation in prescribing. For some patients, more recent eGFR measures may have been available to the prescribing GP in letters or discharge summaries from secondary care, while the result available to us from serum creatinine tests could have been measured during a previous acute illness. This misclassification may in part explain why, even in recent years, nearly 10% of patients appear to initiate treatment with metformin despite levels of renal function that should have contraindicated its use. We have not analysed drug intensification patterns for patients who did not initiate treatment with a period of metformin monotherapy although this is a small minority over recent years. We may have included a proportion of patients with T1DM, both those who commenced treatment with insulin, and those who started on drug therapy but were later reclassified. However, people commencing insulin accounted for only 2% of drug initiations over the whole period so this is unlikely to have a substantial impact on our results. Finally, since our definition of intensification was based on receiving a further metformin prescription, we may have misclassified some patients as switching from metformin monotherapy rather than intensifying treatment. For example, we will have excluded some patients who died after intensifying treatment before receiving a further metformin prescription. 

The prescribing trends we identified are in keeping with a study completed using a different source of UK primary care data that examined prescribing up to 2013.23 International comparisons also show similar trends with falls in SU prescriptions and increases in metformin use, accounting for 68% of treatment initiations in Italy in 2012, 77% in the USA in 2016, while our estimate was 84%.3 24 

Our work has also highlighted an increase in prescribing of DPP4is for treatment intensification, similar to findings in the UK and the USA.23 25 The additional period to 2017 covered by our analysis shows that these trends continued, with additional growth in SGLT2i prescribing. 

Our results are also consistent with data from OpenPrescribing, a website that allows access to absolute numbers of near real-time GP prescriptions.26 OpenPrescribing shows increased prescribing of DPP4is and SGLT2is but does not distinguish prescribing at different stages of treatment as we present here. 

In relation to prescribing for patients with reduced renal function, our work mirrors prescribing trends from a recent US study that described prescribing over time in people with CKD, in particular the increasing use of DPP4is.27 Our finding that metformin continues to be prescribed for patients with T2DM and severely impaired renal function echoes work from France which found that for a cohort of people with reduced renal function prescribed metformin, the prescription was against contraindications in 49% of cases, and Italy where 15% of participants with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were still prescribed metformin.28 29 

Encouragingly, we have found that prescribing at initiation of drug treatment for T2DM largely follows national guidelines and concordance has improved over time. We have highlighted that uptake of new drugs at the first stage of intensification has increased rapidly over recent years with marked regional variation suggesting factors outside of clinical indication may be important; guidance from local bodies to CCGs, drug company marketing, local secondary care practice and patient demand may all influence prescribing.30 Growing evidence that SGLT2is may offer long-term benefits for prevention of cardiovascular disease, results not previously seen for other treatments, may also have influenced prescribing, although guidelines have not yet been altered.20 31 Increasing use of patented drugs will drive up prescribing costs, an issue of concern as drugs for diabetes now account for approximately 10% of the total cost of National Health Service primary care prescribing spending.32 

In conclusion, our results showed marked changes in prescribing for T2DM since 2000 with large increases in prescribing of the new agents. There is substantial variation between regions and CCGs, despite no national guidance towards prescribing of specific agents. The factors underlying choice of drug options for the first stage of intensification are unexplained, and whether drug choice affects future clinical outcomes needs to be determined."
53,6300940,2018,The Journal of international medical research,The effects of 12-month administration of tofogliflozin on electrolytes and dehydration in mainly elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"While SGLT2 inhibitors, including tofogliflozin, are known to ameliorate body weight, blood pressure, liver function, serum lipids and uric acid, as well as improving glucose metabolism in patients with T2DM.11 they are associated with side effects including urinary tract infections, hypoglycaemia, dehydration, and skin complications.4 Indeed, hyperketonaemia, ketonuria and pollakiuria have been reported in Japanese patients with T2DM following treatment with tofogliflozin.12 To our knowledge, this present study is the first to investigate the long-term effects of tofogliflozin on electrolyte concentrations (i.e., sodium potassium, chloride) in mainly elderly Japanese patients with T2DM. Although serum electrolyte concentrations following tofogliflozin treatment have been assessed previously, by comparison with this present study, the investigation involved 20 younger adults with T2DM and the assessment period was just eight weeks.13 

This present study showed that while there was a significant reduction in HbA1c over the 12-month treatment period with tofogliflozin, the drug had no effect on haematocrit, electrolytes, eGFR or BUN/creatinine ratio. The favourable effects of tofogliflozin on HbA1c levels observed in this study are consistent with previous findings which have shown that HbA1c gradually decreases during the first three months of treatment and are then maintained at constant low levels thereafter.14 However, by comparison with our results, a previous study observed an increase in haematocrit from 40.3% to 42.6% after eight weeks of treatment with tofogliflozin.13 The authors concluded that the effect may be attributed to haemoconcentration because of osmotic diuresis.13 Interestingly, although 13% of the subjects in our study used diuretics, which are known to elevate haemoconcentration, haematocrit levels across the whole population remained stable throughout the 12 months of tofogliflozin treatment. In addition, our results were obtained from a population where 77% patients were ≥65 years of age and had significantly lower kidney function than younger patient as assessed by eGFR. However, there were no differences between younger and older patients in baseline values for HbA1c, haematocrit, electrolytes and BUN/creatinine ratios. In addition, although the patients in the present study used a variety of other anti-T2DM drugs, no previous drug-drug interaction has been reported for tofogliflozin.15,16 

Limitations of the present study include the small sample size, the retrospective design and lack of a control group. In addition, confounding factors such as food and fluid intake, concurrent medications and medical history were not considered and may have influenced the study outcome. Furthermore, only serum levels of sodium, potassium and chloride were assessed. Previous research has suggested tofogliflozin has an effect on magnesium and phosphate levels.9 Therefore, future longitudinal, controlled, prospective investigations involving large numbers of patients and assessing more electrolytes are required to confirm the current results. 

In conclusion, this retrospective analysis of data from mainly elderly Japanese patients with T2DM showed that 12-month administration of tofogliflozin exhibited glucose-lowering capabilities with accompanying low risk of electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration."
55,7473803,2020,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",Prediction of the effect of dapagliflozin on kidney and heart failure outcomes based on short-term changes in multiple risk markers.,"Changes in biomarkers can be used to monitor and predict the efficacy of therapies to decrease the risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. In this study we used an algorithm that translates the short-term effect of an intervention on multiple risk markers into a predicted long-term risk change on clinical outcomes. The algorithm was used to predict the effect of dapagliflozin on kidney and HF outcomes in patients with T2DM and CKD. Our results indicate that treatment with dapagliflozin would confer considerable improvements in kidney and HF outcomes in these patients. These results support a large dapagliflozin outcome trial to confirm long-term safety and efficacy in reducing adverse clinical events. 

As with most short-term clinical trials testing the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, the dapagliflozin trials included in this study were primarily designed to assess the effects of dapagliflozin on HbA1c [15–17, 19–21, 23]. Our analysis suggests that glycaemic effects of dapagliflozin only modestly contribute in reducing the risk of kidney outcomes. Non-glycaemic effects of dapagliflozin, in particular the albuminuria-lowering properties, are probably more important contributors of the predicted effects on kidney outcomes. Indeed, prior studies have suggested that albuminuria lowering is a key to reducing kidney outcomes [24, 25]. 

A meta-analysis of cardiovascular events across the dapagliflozin Phases 2b and 3 programmes suggested beneficial effects of dapagliflozin on cardiovascular and HF outcomes [26]. In line with these results, empagliflozin reduced the occurrence of hospitalization for HF by 35% in the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients–Removing Excess Glucose and by 39% in the subgroup of patients with diabetes and kidney disease [27]. Likewise, another large-scale cardiovascular outcome study, the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study, reported a decrease in hospitalization for HF of 33% in patients randomized to canagliflozin versus placebo [7]. The recently completed Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 trial investigated the effects of dapagliflozin in patients at high cardiovascular risk and reported that dapagliflozin reduced the occurrence of the composite kidney outcome by 47%. Furthermore, risk for hospitalization due to HF decreased by 27% on dapagliflozin [5]. A meta-analysis of the three cardiovascular outcome trials confirmed the consistent and strong effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing the risk of hospitalization for HF and progression of renal disease [28]. These observed effects are very similar to our PRE score predictions in patients with elevated albuminuria. The ongoing Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease trial, described in the companion article, will provide a more clear answer whether the predicted effects of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD are accurate (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03036150). 

Although the mechanisms underlying the multipotent action of SGLT2 inhibitors are not completely understood, several lines of evidence suggest that the normalization of tubuloglomerular feedback plays a key role in the renoprotective effects [29]. In addition, dapagliflozin-induced natriuretic/osmotic diuresis and the resultant volume contraction may contribute to enhanced fluid clearance from the interstitial space and explain the reduction in HF risk [30–32]. However, the favourable cardiorenal effects of dapagliflozin are potentially counterbalanced by other non-beneficial effects, including alterations in calcium and phosphate homeostasis [33]. Prior studies have shown modest increases in phosphate during dapagliflozin therapy that were explained by increased activity of the Na+3-PO34− transporter, leading to a reduction in phosphate clearance and compensatory increases in parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor 23 [33–35]. The increase in serum phosphate levels observed in our analysis translated into a small increase in estimated kidney and HF risk. Yet the benefits associated with improvements in multiple risk markers outweighed this small increase in risk. 

What is the applicability of the PRE score for future clinical trials and patient care? Changes in single risk markers often insufficiently predict the long-term drug effect on clinical outcomes, as shown by multiple clinical trials [22, 36–38]. Integrating multiple short-term risk marker changes has the potential to better predict long-term treatment effects [39]. Accurate long-term risk prediction is important to better predict the long-term effect of a drug in daily patient care as well as to improve the design of clinical trials. As such, the PRE score can be used in clinical practice to better predict the long-term effect of a drug for an individual patient and during early drug development to determine if a new drug is likely to be effective and to inform power and sample size calculations [39]. 

A main limitation of this study is that we could not include all relevant biomarkers that are associated with kidney and HF outcomes. For example, we ideally would have used N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide as a marker for volume status instead of body weight, as the latter may merely represent initial volume contraction rather than sustained alterations in fluid handling. In addition, the number of patients with UACR >200 mg/g and eGFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was relatively small, which limits the precision of our effect estimates. Furthermore, some patients did not use concomitant RAAS inhibition. In the ongoing kidney outcome trials of SGLT2 inhibitors, nearly all patients are receiving RAAS inhibition. We do not believe, however, this influences our predictions, as it has been shown that the effects of dapagliflozin on all cardiovascular risk markers included in our analysis are consistent regardless of concomitant RAAS inhibition [40]. 

In conclusion, the PRE score predicted clinically meaningful reductions in kidney and HF endpoints associated with dapagliflozin therapy in patients with diabetic kidney disease. These results support a large long-term outcome trial in this population to confirm the benefits of the drug on these endpoints."
56,6624389,2019,British journal of clinical pharmacology,"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling for renal function dependent urinary glucose excretion effect of ipragliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, both in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","The developed PK/PD model described the relationship between the individual plasma ipragliflozin exposure (AUC24h) and ΔUGE24h as a pharmacological effect of ipragliflozin. The PopPK model was developed in order to assess the individual AUC24h in patients with T2DM from sparse PK samples. In a previous publication, we described increase in UGE using an Emax model predicted by AUC24h and the initial excretion level (E0).20 In the model, however, the impact of renal function on UGE was not considered, thus the Emax need to be estimated separately for healthy subjects and patients with T2DM. The new model established in this article provides the mechanism‐based pharmacological effect of SGLT2 inhibitor both healthy subjects and patients with T2DM in 1 model by taking into consideration the individual FPG and GFR. 

In healthy individuals, about 180 g of glucose (calculated as the primitive urine production of 180 L/24 h times the normal FPG level of 100 mg/dL) is filtered daily at the renal glomeruli and nearly 100% of filtered glucose is reabsorbed at the renal tubules.19 In other words, both FPG and GFR are determinative factors of UGE. SGLT2 is expressed at the renal proximal tubules and accounts for over 90% of renal glucose reabsorption.21 When the blood glucose level is higher than the maximum capacity of reabsorption (approximately 180 mg/dL), glucose is then excreted into urine. Beyond the threshold, urinary glucose increases in a linear fashion with increasing plasma glucose level.18, 19 SGLT2 inhibitors lower the maximum capacity of glucose reabsorption. 

The relationship between FPG, GFR and UGE are clearly indicated by the observed clinical data taken from patients with ipragliflozin in studies A, B and C, which are schematically presented in Figure 3. The figure shows that the threshold value for reabsorption at baseline used in the PK/PD modelling (FPG × GFR = 18 000 or 180 g/24 h) is physiologically adequate if considering the pharmacological effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. As obvious based on the mechanism, the maximum effect on UGE of SGLT2 (ΔUGE24h) never exceeds filtered glucose. Therefore, Emax of ΔUGE24h was parameterized by product of FPG and GFR in this article. 

In the PK/PD analysis, the estimated Emax was 140 g/24 h in Japanese T2DM patients with the reference FPG (160 mg/dL) and GFR (90 mL/min). A comparable Emax for empagliflozin (120 g/24 h) was reported in T2DM patients with a mean FPG of 8–9 mmol/L (144–162 mg/dL).22 The Emax of these SGLT2 inhibitors are estimated to be about 40–50% compared to total amount of filtered glucose (288 g: FPG 160 mg/dL × primitive urine production: 180 L/24 h). The absence of complete inhibition of urinary glucose reabsorption was also found even under the condition with almost no SGLT2 activity expected to be remained in empagliflozin and dapagliflozin studies.22, 23 The incomplete inhibition mainly attributes to contribution of reabsorption by SGLT1 expressed in the luminal membrane of the late proximal tubule.24, 25 

The final PopPK model indicates fixed effects of BSA, GFR, TPRO and TBIL as statistically significant covariates on ipragliflozin exposure. GFR is thought to be a dominant factor to affect ipragliflozin exposure, whereas the other covariates will cause only 10% or less change in the exposure. Despite the negligible urinary excretion of unchanged ipragliflozin,3, 5 renal function significantly influences ipragliflozin exposure. Both the descriptive comparison of assessed AUC as well as simulation by the final PopPK model indicate about 20% higher exposure in moderate renal impairment patients with T2DM.5 Although GFR has been recognized as a dominant factor affecting ipragliflozin exposure, there is some uncertainty for the application of the model to the T2DM patients with severely impaired renal function who have not been studied in the clinical studies. 

By contrast, the PK/PD model suggests that glucose excretion effect almost reaches the maximum level at above 50 mg daily dose of iplagliflozin. Based on the established PK/PD model, it is suggested that any excessive drug effect cannot be expected in renal impairment patients due to the higher exposure caused by renal impairment. In addition, lower GFR in renal impairment patients results in lower urinary filtrated glucose; therefore, the drug effect (ΔUGE24h) by ipragliflozin is lower. Our model well described the result of the lower UGE in renal impairment patients with T2DM found in study C.5 Furthermore, the lower decrease in FPG and HbA1c by ipragliflozin was confirmed in the long‐term study in renal impairment patients (study G).9 Recently, de Winter et al. reported a dynamic PK/PD model for HbA1c decreasing effect of canagliflozin.26 In this report, GFR was a significant covariate of Emax and the outcome was simulated by normalized HbA1c level at baseline. The results are consistent with our findings, and it also supports our assumption that UGE effect by SGLT2 inhibitor must link directly to the clinical outcome. 

The developed PK/PD and PopPK models enables to provide individual response of increase in UGE by ipragliflozin. The relationship between the pharmacological effect (ΔUGE) and the long‐term clinical outcomes, i.e. FPG or HbA1c, will be further modelled in future articles."
58,6662129,2019,Journal of the American Heart Association,Changes in the Prescription of Glucose-Lowering Medications in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus After a Cardiovascular Event: A Call to Action From the DATAFILE Study.,"In this analysis of therapeutic appropriateness in the real world, we found that occurrence of a CVE in patients with T2DM prompted marginal changes in the prescription of GLMs, with no increase in drugs provided with protective cardiovascular effects and no decrease in drugs with a high risk of hypoglycemia. Rather, there was a significant change in the prescription pattern of typical cardiovascular medications, suggestive of a more intensive control of risk factors. Consistently, patients with CVE showed an improvement in blood pressure and lipid profile but no reduction in HbA1c, which remained suboptimal. 

Positive results of CVOTs published since 2015 are now being incorporated into guidelines1 and medicine labels. With some very recent exceptions, such studies have been conducted mostly in T2DM patients with established CVD, and there is consensus that results cannot be automatically extrapolated to patients without CVD.26 Therefore, one would expect prescriptions of SGLT2i and GLP‐1RA to increase in patients with T2DM and CVD, for whom a clear benefit in the prevention of CVE has been shown. We designed the DATAFILE study to evaluate whether and to what extent occurrence of a CVE drove modifications in the prescription of drugs for the treatment of T2DM. The study was performed at diabetes mellitus specialist clinics, as general practitioners were not allowed to initiate prescription of DPP‐4i, GLP‐1RA, and SGLT2i in Italy during the study period. Extracting data from the databases of diabetes mellitus outpatient clinics assured that prescriptions were made or at least validated by diabetologists, and were not simply those made by the specialist(s) who cared for the patients during the CVE. Notably, we observed minimal changes in GLM prescriptions and none going in the direction of improved appropriateness. The significant deprescription of metformin may be attributable to the fact that some patients developed contraindications to metformin, such as renal impairment or respiratory failure during or after the CVE.27, 28 This is suggested by the eGFR reduction observed in patients no longer prescribed metformin, although there was no patient with an eGFR decline below 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Because a wide range of observational data suggest that metformin can be safely used in patients with CVD and with CKD up to an eGFR of 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2,29, 30, 31 metformin deprescription seems to reflect an inappropriate lack of confidence in the safety of this drug. 

Internal validity of the analysis was demonstrated by the increased prescription of several cardiovascular medications in patients after a CVE, which was expected. When the analysis was restricted to the period when SGLT2i were available and CVOTs on SGLT2i and GLP‐1RA were being published, still no increase in cardioprotective GLMs was observed. These results suggest that, while intensive control of risk factors is pursued in clinical practice, optimization of the GLM regimen is an unmet need in patients with T2DM after a CVE in a diabetes mellitus specialist care setting. 

Some limitations of this study are intrinsic to its retrospective nature. There was no prospective data recording, the electronic chart was not linked to administrative data, and CVEs were recorded as reported by physicians. Thus, an eventual underreporting would imply that not all patients with incident CVEs were identified (eg, for peripheral revascularization, having the highest percentage of absence) and that some controls without a recorded CVE may actually have experienced an event. This may have caused an underestimation of the treatment difference between the 2 groups. Yet, even within the group of patients with a reported CVE, changes in GLM prescription were marginal, suggesting that underreporting of CVEs was not a major cause of the negative results of our analysis. Nonetheless, as typically occurring in retrospective studies on data routinely collected for clinical purposes, there was a substantial absence of data for other important variables. Although it was impossible to evaluate whether patients actually took the prescribed medications, the study focused on diabetologists’ prescribing attitudes, thereby being unrelated to information on drug dispensation and compliance. Finally, we collected data only at 3 to 12 months after the event, and long‐term information was not available. This is important because changes in medications for the control of risk factors (eg, LDL cholesterol) may be prioritized over changes in GLMs soon after an acute CVE. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that only 2 CVOTs enrolled patients soon (3–6 months) after an acute event, and they showed no cardiovascular protection by the GLP‐1RA lixisenatide32 and the DPP‐4i alogliptin,11 thereby making the urgency of changing the GLM prescription questionable. Nonetheless, therapeutic inertia has been clearly documented to worsen outcomes of patients with diabetes mellitus,33, 34 which is important, especially in view of the fact that HbA1c remained high. 

The reasons why HbA1c did not decline in the CVE group are likely manifold and possibly include the choice of less ambitious HbA1c targets because of (1) concomitant use of drugs with a high hypoglycemia risk (sulfonylureas and insulin), (2) comorbidities (mainly chronic kidney disease and CVD), and (3) patients being considered more fragile after a CVE. Altogether, a cautious approach in the treatment of these patients emerges along with a limited awareness of the beneficial cardiovascular effects of SGLT2i and GLP1‐RA. It should be noted that some reimbursement restrictions imposed on GLP‐1RA and SGLT2i during the study period may have prevented the prescription of these GLMs to patients who could have benefited from protection against a CVE and death. 

The study also has remarkable strengths: Patients were well characterized in their clinical profile, with detailed clinical information that is not available in registries or administrative databases. In addition, the match between cases and controls was good, with only variables directly related to CVE being unbalanced at baseline. 

The present study advocates a call to action for stakeholders involved in diabetes mellitus care. Results of CVOTs available since 2015 should drive a paradigm shift in the treatment of T2DM, with more focus on cardiovascular prevention. We acknowledge that such a paradigm shift, bestowed by national and international guidelines, is still under way, and we will resurvey the situation in the future to monitor this unmet need."
59,6675078,2019,PloS one,Clinical parameters affecting the therapeutic efficacy of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"In the present study, we found that higher baseline HbA1c levels, better renal function, and shorter T2DM duration were predictive markers for more effective lowering of glucose levels using empagliflozin. In addition, the predictive clinical parameters for body weight reduction were higher BMI and lower baseline HbA1c levels. 

Previous studies have reported the clinical predictors of glycemic response to SGLT2 inhibitors [11,13,16,17]. The amount of glucose excreted by SGLT2 inhibitors increases as the plasma glucose concentration increases, which explains why the glucose-lowering effect of an SGLT2 inhibitor was more powerful in patients with poor glycemic control [17,18]. In a phase-III trial comparing empagliflozin monotherapy with sitagliptin in T2DM patients, greater decrease in HbA1c levels were observed in empagliflozin-treated patients with the highest baseline HbA1c levels [11]. In a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the effects of a combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin in T2DM patients, higher baseline HbA1c levels were predictive of the higher clinical efficacy of empagliflozin [13]. In a recent study in Korea, T2DM patients with poor glucose control were more likely to benefit from treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin [16]. Another retrospective study in Japan also reported that high baseline HbA1c levels were an independent predictor of the glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [17]. Consistent with previous studies, our findings showed that the reduction in HbA1c levels in patients taking empagliflozin was associated with high baseline HbA1c levels. 

The glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is due to their glucosuric effect in the kidneys, where SGLT2 is extracellularly inhibited in the lumen of the proximal tubule when the SGLT2 inhibitors are filtered by the glomerulus [19]. Compared with placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors did not improve the glycemic control in patients with moderate renal impairment [20]. Therefore, it can be speculated that SGLT2 inhibitors are only effective in individuals with healthy renal function. In fact, the Korean and Japanese studies mentioned above both found that good renal function was another independent predictive marker for better glycemic response to SGLT2 inhibitors [16,17]. Our findings add further evidence that good renal function can act as a predictive marker for better responses to empagliflozin therapy. 

Moreover, our findings–which indicated that shorter T2DM duration is a predictor of better glycemic responses to empagliflozin–is in agreement with those of previous studies. An ASSIGN-K study found that SGLT2 inhibitors were more effective in patients with a shorter duration of diabetes and in those with high baseline HbA1c levels [21]. As explained in ASSIGN-K study, one possible explanation for this is that the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors may be reduced in patients with a longer disease duration due to the upregulation of SGLT2 expression or the elevation of the renal glucose threshold [21]. Further studies are needed to identify the predictive role and underlying mechanisms of disease duration on the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in T2DM patients. 

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide, reaching epidemic proportions due to the rising levels of obesity [22]. The mean BMI of Korean diabetic patients is gradually increasing, and recent studies have found that half of the patients in Korea with diabetes are obese [1,2]. In this vein, SGLT2 inhibitors are a promising therapeutic option as the use of these inhibitors can result in weight loss in addition to better glycemic control [23]. We found that empagliflozin was associated with weight loss in T2DM patients, with an average body weight reduction of 2.0 ± 2.7 kg from baseline levels. We also found that patients with a higher baseline BMI lost more weight within the observation period (Fig 2B), although baseline BMI was not associated with better glycemic control (Fig 1B). In addition, there was no significant correlation between decrease in HbA1c and decrease in body weight among patients taking empagliflozin (S3 Fig). These findings were in agreement with those of previous studies, which used the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin [16]. Baseline BMI was not significantly associated with glycemic improvement by dapagliflozin. Additionally, no significant correlation was observed between dapagliflozin’s glucose-lowering effects and loss of body weight. This study suggested that compensatory hyperphagia in obese patients could be a possible explanation for this observation [16]. The overexpression or overactivation of SGLT2 in obese T2DM patients could be another possible explanation for the variations in the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors [16]. 

Another important finding from our study is that higher baseline HbA1c levels were associated with less weight reduction (Fig 2C). One possible explanation for this is that insulin resistance may affect the patient’s response to empagliflozin therapy. Interestingly, while the difference was not statistically significant, HOMA-IR levels tended to be higher in the HbA1c responder group and lower in the body weight responder group (S1 and S2 Tables). Therefore, it is possible that severe insulin resistance is related to better glycemic control and a reduction in the rate of weight loss in patients taking empagliflozin. However, as the HOMA-IR data of several study participants were unavailable, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of HOMA-IR on the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors. 

This study has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective study without a placebo group. Second, only Korean patients were included in this study. Third, patients’ lifestyles including diet and exercise were not monitored. Fourth, the content of the meal to measure postprandial plasma glucose levels has not been standardized. Lastly, the follow-up period was relatively short; therefore, we could not assess the long-term effects of empagliflozin treatment. Despite these limitations, we have revealed indicators of glycaemic responses and weight loss with empagliflozin treatment. Our finding could suggest some guidance on prescribing empagliflozin to T2DM patients for clinicians. Furthermore, this retrospective observational study used data based on practice in a real-world clinical setting, which is meaningful in a clinical aspect."
60,6814842,2019,Scientific reports,"Effect of Empagliflozin on Cardiac Function, Adiposity, and Diffuse Fibrosis in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.","In this study, we showed that, overall, 6 months of empagliflozin treatment did not significantly improve the LV function, structure, adiposity, and diffuse fibrosis in patients with T2DM. We also demonstrated that the beneficial effects of empagliflozin treatment might be more evident in patients with worse baseline LV substrate and structure. 

T2DM is an independent risk factor of heart failure with adverse effects on the function and structure of the heart15. The development of diabetic cardiomyopathy is slow and silent when there are no other confounding factors such as CAD, hypertension, and valvular heart disease. Diastolic dysfunction is considered the most frequent and an early sign of myocardial dysfunction that could emerge even in the early stage of T2DM16–18. The pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy is complex. In normal individuals, myocardial energy is mainly derived from the metabolism of glucose and free fatty acids through the lipolysis of adipose tissue; however, in diabetic patients, the energy sources are shifted to the beta-oxidation of fatty acids because of the depletion of glucose transporters 1 and 4, in which the oxygen demand is higher and energy imbalance occurs. Free fatty acids inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase, accumulate glycolytic intermediates and ceramide, and further promote apoptosis15,19. In a previous study using 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), myocardial TG content was increased in diabetic patients and associated with impaired LV diastolic function14,20. Although the proportion of patients with systolic versus diastolic dysfunction in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial is unknown, diastolic dysfunction was reported to be present in >60% of subjects with diabetes21. 

Cardiac MRI has provided a unique view of subclinical lipid overload-related myocardial remodelling. Studies using cardiac MRI have established an association between myocardial steatosis and LV dysfunction independent of age, diastolic blood pressure, and BMI in T2DM14,22,23. However, the effects of therapeutic interventions on the myocardial substrate of patients with T2DM have been seldom studied. One report showed that 16 weeks of caloric restriction in patients with T2DM seemed to decrease the myocardial TG content along with improvements in LV diastolic function, LV mass, and E/A ratio24. Another study showed that although pioglitazone, in comparison with metformin, could improve LV function and alter the myocardial substrate metabolism in patients with T2DM, no therapeutic effect on myocardial TG content was noted25. Empagliflozin is the first oral anti-hyperglycaemic agent proven to have benefits on the CV outcome. Therefore, it is of clinical interest to determine if empagliflozin would have beneficial effects on the heart function/structure and myocardial substrate. In one human study, 3 months of empagliflozin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in LVMi and an improvement in diastolic function8. Recently, Verma et al. conducted the EMPA-HEART CardioLink-6 trial and enrolled 97 patients with T2DM and established CAD. This study showed that 6 months of empagliflozin treatment could lower the LVMi and that, when LVMi was >60 g/m2, the regression of LV mass was associated with the baseline LV mass26. 

Despite the impressive results, the potential mechanisms remain largely unexplained. The unique pharmacological profile of SGLT2 inhibitors places them at the crossroads of important haemodynamic, neurohumoral, metabolic, and vascular endothelial pathways influencing cardiac and renal diseases. There are several potential direct and indirect pathways leading to the improvement of heart structure, function, and myocardial substrate induced by SGLT2. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with diabetes could provide better glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity and reduce arterial blood pressure, arterial stiffness, body weight, and visceral fat27–30. Recent studies further demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors could reset the tubuloglomerular feedback, leading to volume contraction without the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and harmful glomerular hyperfiltration31. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors might improve the efficiency of myocardial energy utilization by offering β-hydroxybutyrate as an attractive fuel for oxidation6. These multiple non-glycaemic effects support SGLT2 inhibitors as the preferred glucose-lowering drug for treating diabetic patients with heart failure. 

Although the current study failed to demonstrate improvements in heart function/structure and myocardial substrate, we found that the greater the accumulation of intracardiac TG content, pericardial fat, and diffuse fibrosis at baseline, the better the improvements of these components after 6 months of empagliflozin treatment. The discrepancy between our findings and those of previous studies8,26 might be attributed to the different study populations and the lower severity of T2DM, fewer comorbidities, normal or milder heart function impairment, and myocardial substrate change in our study. Nevertheless, our results are in accordance with the current observations that patients with worse baseline characteristics benefit more from the treatment. 

The adiposity of the heart has been proven to be significantly associated with heart function. For example, pericardial fat is associated with metabolic risks, severity of CAD, adverse LV remodelling, and sudden cardiac death32–35. The impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on the adiposity and fibrosis content of the liver has been addressed by several studies. For example, tofogliflozin and ipragliflozin have been shown to prevent hepatic TG accumulation and fibrosis in obese rats36. A study pooling randomized trials including EMPA-REG demonstrated a highly consistent result that empagliflozin reduces aminotransferases in patients with T2DM, which potentially indicates a reduction in liver fat30. Thus far, there is no report on the effects of SGLT2 on the adiposity (cardiac steatosis and pericardial fat) and fibrosis content of the heart. As the first study enrolling patients with worse baseline disease severity and cardiac characteristics, our current study might be important in clarifying these issues. 

This study has some limitations. First, the study population was small and no control (non-diabetic) group was enrolled in this study. Second, instead of echocardiographic measurements, we used only LVPFR to represent LV diastolic function, which might be an insensitive indicator. Third, we used non-invasive MRS to quantify the intracardiac TG content and myocardial diffuse fibrosis without performing histological examination to validate the results. Fourth, whether the results of this study on empagliflozin can be extrapolated to all SGLT2 inhibitors is questionable. Finally, the lack of a significant reduction of HbA1c may raise the possibility that some patients might have poor compliance with the medication despite our careful efforts to confirm the compliance of patients. Nevertheless, the significant increase in haematocrit, reduction in blood pressure, and persistent glucosuria during the study imply that most of the patients had fair compliance. 

In conclusion, we demonstrated that, overall, 6 months of empagliflozin treatment did not significantly improve the LV function, structure, adiposity, and diffuse fibrosis in patients with T2DM. However, we found that the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on the intracardiac TG content, pericardial fat, and ECV might be more evident in patients with worse baseline LV substrate and structure."
62,7370973,2020,Advances in therapy,Pooled Safety and Tolerability Analysis of Empagliflozin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial in patients with T2DM and established CV disease, empagliflozin reduced the risk of CV death by 38% compared with placebo [15]. Patients treated with empagliflozin also experienced a 32% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, a 35% reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure, and a 39% reduction in the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy [15, 16, 38]. In addition, empagliflozin has been estimated to increase life expectancy by an average of 1–4.5 years (depending on age), compared with placebo [39]. 

This analysis of pooled safety data for empagliflozin was of an expanded dataset previously used to investigate the safety and tolerability of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM [21]. Whereas the earlier analysis was based on more than 15,000 patient-years’ exposure to empagliflozin [21], the present expanded dataset was based on more than 16,480 patient-years’ exposure. 

Following this earlier analysis [21], the present analysis showed a consistent AE profile and further continued to show that empagliflozin has a good safety profile and is well tolerated in patients with T2DM. In addition, the risk of hypoglycemia was similar for empagliflozin compared with placebo, except when co-administered with insulin and/or an SU. 

Due to their mechanism of action, SGLT2 inhibitors cause transient increases in urine volume [1, 2], leading to acknowledgement of its potential for volume depletion and hypotension, particularly in the elderly population. The present analyses showed that the risk of volume depletion for empagliflozin compared with placebo was numerically increased in patients aged 75 to < 85 years, and in patients with concomitant use of loop diuretics, but not in patients with concomitant use of other diuretics, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, or other antihypertensive drugs. 

Similarly, UTIs and genital infections are both identified risks associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use, with increases in urinary glucose concentration a potential exacerbating factor [40]. The present data continue to support previous findings that there is no empagliflozin-specific increased risk of UTIs when compared with placebo. Furthermore, the notion that increased urinary glucose concentration and excretion might predispose to UTIs may be counterbalanced with the hypothesis that increased urinary flow due to osmotic diuresis may reduce or balance the potential impact of increased urinary glucose concentration. The risk of genital infection was elevated for empagliflozin compared with placebo, but excess events associated with empagliflozin were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity and seldom led to treatment discontinuation. There was no increased risk of complicated UTIs or complicated genital infections associated with empagliflozin compared with placebo. 

The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a serious complication associated with diabetes that arises when the body produces high levels of ketones, may be increased by the use of SGLT2 inhibitors [41]. No imbalance in diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported in clinical trials [15, 17, 18], and there was a similar frequency in the present data for patients treated with empagliflozin compared with placebo. Despite this, in 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety announcement of the potential for an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment [42]. This was the result of post-marketing reports, coupled with a potential mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors involving the metabolic shift towards lipid utilization, leading to increased ketone body production, particularly during prolonged fasting [43]. As a result, the labels for all SGLT2 inhibitors were updated with a warning of this complication [44]. 

Recently, based on a number of post-marketing reports, the labels for SGLT2 inhibitors were also updated with an adverse reaction of Fournier’s gangrene, which is a rare but serious urological condition, characterized by a progressive necrotizing infection that affects the external genitalia or the perineum [45]. No cases of Fournier’s gangrene have been reported in clinical trials with empagliflozin. Six cases of Fournier’s gangrene were recorded in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, one in the dapagliflozin group and five in the placebo group [18]. 

Previously, a concern of bladder cancer relating to SGLT2 inhibitor use was raised, particularly in relation to dapagliflozin [46, 47]. However, this risk was not confirmed in the DECLARE–TIMI 58 trial, a large placebo-controlled CV outcome trial [18]. There was also no increased risk of urinary tract cancer in the present analysis. In addition, an analysis of patients with at least 6 months’ drug exposure in EMPA-REG OUTCOME® was undertaken to assess the risk of bladder cancer [48]. The incidence, with an onset after 6 months’ cumulative exposure to the study drug, was reported in 10/4406 patients (0.2%) in the empagliflozin 10/25 mg group and 4/2187 patients (0.2%) in the placebo group. The authors concluded that, based on the totality of the data, no imbalance in bladder cancer cases between empagliflozin and placebo was observed in EMPA-REG OUTCOME® [48]. 

The CANVAS program reported an increased risk of fractures and LLAs with canagliflozin use, with LLAs consistent for minor and major amputations [17]. In 2017, regulators reviewed available data for possible associations between SGLT2 inhibitors and LLAs. They concluded that canagliflozin may increase the risk of LLA, and the US Food and Drug Administration issued a boxed warning to the canagliflozin label describing the increased risk of leg and foot amputations [49]. In the current analysis, there was no evidence of an association between empagliflozin use and LLAs. The overall frequency of amputations was the same for empagliflozin compared with placebo. In addition, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial found that the proportion of patients with an LLA was similar between the empagliflozin and placebo groups [21]. Similarly, the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial of over 17,000 patients found no increased risk of amputations between dapagliflozin and placebo [18]. A meta-analysis of the CANVAS program, EMPA-REG OUTCOME® and DECLARE-TIMI 58 trials showed that the increased risk of amputations and fractures in the CANVAS program contributed moderate to high percentages of the total variation across the three trials that was due to heterogeneity (I2 = 79.1% for amputations and I2 = 42.1% for fractures) [5]. In the recent CREDENCE study in 4401 patients with diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease receiving canagliflozin or placebo on top of standard of care, there was no significant difference in the rates of amputation reported (HR 1.11 [95% CI 0.79, 1.56]) [50]. 

Other potential risks associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use, including liver injury, bone fracture, and pancreatitis, all occurred at a similar frequency for patients treated with empagliflozin and placebo. The events related to renal impairment for patients with reduced eGFR were similar for patients treated with empagliflozin compared with placebo. 

Strengths of this analysis include the large sample size and patient exposure. Weaknesses include that the studies were of varying durations and that differences between groups were not compared using modeled analyses."
63,7386974,2020,Medicine,Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin vs monotherapy as added to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes: A meta-analysis.,"An ideal therapy strategy for T2DM should be effective in controlling HbA1c and body weight without causing hypoglycemia. According to the statements from American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology, glycemic control, weight reduction and lower blood pressure are accurate indicators to evaluate T2DM, and the triple oral medication achieved unanimous improvement among new diagnosed T2DM patients with HbA1c level of 9%.[26] At present, metformin combining with other hypoglycemic agents such as sulfonylurea, GLP-1 analogue, DPP-4 inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors become main clinical triple oral hypoglycemic regimens for the treatment of T2DM, but the related clinical evidence of triple oral medication on safety and effectiveness are still insufficient. 

Some clinical trials had explored the effectiveness and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin for the treatment of T2DM patients who had inadequate glycemic control with metformin alone, and significant reduction of HbA1c was observed after medication. Moreover, the sustained-release dapagliflozin/saxagliptin tablet of fixed-dosage combination could better improve the level of HbA1c, and this is consistent bioequivalence with taking dapagliflozin and saxagliptin.[27] Additionally, dapagliflozin/saxagliptin have complementary mechanism in improving alpha and beta cells integrity, increasing the concentrations of C-peptide and insulin, and boosting beta cells function.[28] 

In our study, we systematically evaluated the effectiveness and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin vs monotherapy as added to metformin in patients with T2DM, the results indicated that dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin and metformin could significantly increase adjusted mean change levels of HbA1c and FPG, which beat dapagliflozin plus metformin or saxagliptin plus metformin therapies. These results were consistent with previous studies.[25] Among all included studies, the maximum of adjusted mean reduction of HbA1c were 1.47%, 1.2% and 0.9% in recipients of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin plus metformin, dapagliflozin plus metformin, and saxagliptin plus metformin, respectively. Recently study found that the durability of glycemia control with dapagliflozin was greater than saxagliptin in patients with T2DM, which lasted more than 24 weeks.[29] Other study indicated that dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin as add-on to metformin also exhibit better tolerance in glycemia control.[30] 

As for body weight effects, our results indicated that no obvious difference was observed among patients taking DSM and DM (P > .05), but DSM therapy proved to be more effective in body weight loss than SM (P < .05). Previous researches confirmed that SGLT2 inhibitors could lower blood glucose and control weight at the same time, and the mechanism of weight loss resided in higher glucose excretion through the kidneys, promoting the breakdown of glycogen, thus maintaining a negative energy balance of the whole body and resulting in weight control.[31] A post hoc analysis suggested that the reduction of weight loss was 2.29 kg in patients treated with dapagliflozin for 24 weeks, and the reduction would increase to 4.5 kg when the medication span extended to over 2 years.[32] Meanwhile, DPP-4 inhibitors exhibited neutral effects for weight loss. A Bayesian network meta-analysis indicated that only linagliptin could significantly lower body mass index compared with other DPP-4 inhibitors or placebo, and no statistical significance on body weight control observed when DPP-4 inhibitors were compared with placebo.[33] 

With respect to blood pressure, there was a significant gap of the adjusted mean changes from baseline in SBP between patients with DSM and DM. One study assessed the effects of DSM and DM on the changes of DBP, and two studies evaluated the effects of DSM and SM on the changes of DBP. The results showed that DSM remarkably increased the adjusted mean change of DBP from baseline, which beat the DM therapy, and no statistical significance was observed when compared with SM. However, this was not consistent with the results of a previous study. In a 24-week RCT, the study indicated that DSM worked obviously better on lowering the DBP than SM, while there was no difference between DSM and DM.[24] Therefore, the accuracy of these results still needs further verifications. 

With regard to the side effects, the common adverse reactions of SGLT-2 inhibitors include hypoglycemia, urinary tract infection, genital infection and renal impairment or failure. Previous study found that dapagliflozin was associated with high incidence risk of urinary tract infection and genital infection, and had a dose-dependent relationship.[34] In addition, a meta-analysis evaluated the relationship between SGLT-2 inhibitors and the risk of infections, the results showed that SGLT-2 inhibitors were correlated with higher risk of genital infection, and no such correlation with urinary tract infection detected, but high-dosage of dapagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections.[35] For DPP-4 inhibitors, the common adverse reactions included hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal problems, pancreatitis, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection, while the symptoms of the side effects were mild.[36] In our study, it is indicated that there were no significant difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia, nausea, influenza, urinary tract infection and renal failure between DSM and DM, but DSM had obviously lower risk of genital infection than DM. Furthermore, there was also no significant difference in the incidence of nausea, influenza, headache, diarrhea, urinary tract infection and renal failure between DSM and SM, but a dramatically higher risk of hypoglycemia and genital infection were observed when DSM compared with SM. 

However, there are some potential limitations in our research. First, 7 studies were included in this meta-analysis, but three of them were continuous studies, and this might cause overestimated results. Second, high heterogeneity and potential publication bias were existed during the process of data analysis, which would undermine the accuracy of results. Lastly, small sample size and insufficient data in the selected studies may weaken the credibility of results. Therefore, further research efforts are still needed to further confirm the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of dapagliflozin-saxagliptin-metformin for the treatment of T2DM. 

To sum up, it was indicated that dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin had better effects in reducing the level of HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP and DBP than the monotherapy for the treatment of T2DM when inadequately controlled with metformin alone. Additionally, no more serious side effects were observed when taking with DSM and DM or SM therapy, and DSM could lower the risk of genital infection. Clinically, genital infection should be cautiously monitored when treated with DSM or DM. Therefore, triple therapy with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin and metformin may be a suitable therapy regimen for patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin, and future clinical application of the therapy will still uncover more pros and cons of the combined treating approach and in turn serve as guides for marginal improvement."
64,4569680,2015,Advances in therapy,"Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Safety of Canagliflozin in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.","The Cmax and AUC values of plasma canagliflozin concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner on Days 1 and 16. No marked changes were observed in tmax and t1/2 after multiple doses of canagliflozin. The mean ARs and linearity factors were close to 1 in all canagliflozin groups, and the trough plasma concentration of canagliflozin reached steady state by Day 7 for all doses. These results suggest that there is no accumulation of canagliflozin in plasma. No significant changes in renal clearance were observed after multiple doses at all dose levels. These pharmacokinetic profiles of canagliflozin in Japanese patients were similar to those previously reported in non-Japanese patients [19, 20]. 

Renal glucose reabsorption was rapidly inhibited, and RTG was decreased after canagliflozin administration on Days 1 and 16. A near-maximal RTG-lowering effect was induced in the 100-mg group. The RTG-lowering effects of canagliflozin were not diminished by repeated administration. UGE was markedly increased in all canagliflozin-treated groups. The change in UGE0–24h from baseline was smallest in the 25-mg group, and ranged from 80 to 110 g/day with no great difference in the 100–400-mg groups. Collectively, it is noted that canagliflozin exerts near-maximal efficacy at a dose of 100 mg in Japanese patients with T2DM. The increase in UGE was sustained during repeated-dose administration. The decrease in both MPG0–24h and FPG after single and repeated doses was greater in the canagliflozin groups than in the placebo group. These pharmacodynamic profiles of canagliflozin in Japanese patients were also similar to those in studies with non-Japanese patients [3, 20, 22, 24]. 

In the current short-term study, canagliflozin was well tolerated in patients with T2DM, with a low incidence of AEs. Urinary ketones were observed in 3 patients in canagliflozin-treated groups; 2 cases at a dose of 200 mg and 1 case at a dose of 400 mg. All cases were mild and rapidly returned to a negative level without signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis. It is recommended that patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors should be assessed for ketoacidosis when they present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis to prevent delayed diagnosis and management [25, 26]. We then assessed any influences on urine volume, urine electrolytes, hematocrit, and serum osmolality in patients with T2DM. In canagliflozin-treated groups, although an increasing trend was observed in the 24-h urine volume on Day 1, this increase soon declined toward baseline levels despite the sustained UGE increase, which is similar to previously reported findings [22]. On Day 1, hourly urine volume was slightly increased in the canagliflozin-treated groups compared with the placebo group up to 10.5–13 h, whereas no increase was observed thereafter. Interestingly, this time-course profile of urine volume on Day 1 was similar to that of urinary sodium excretion, suggesting the development of natriuresis during the early stages of canagliflozin treatment. There is a discrepancy between the time-course of urinary sodium increase and urinary glucose excretion. The diuretic effects of a natriuretic antihypertensive agent, such as chlorothiazide, persist only for about 1 week because of a compensatory mechanism against diuresis [27]. Therefore, a similar compensatory mechanism against canagliflozin-induced diuresis may be induced in the later stages. Further investigations remain to be addressed. Volume-related parameters, including mean hematocrit values and serum osmolality, were not markedly changed in the present study although some SGLT2 inhibitors have been reported to increase hematocrit values and transiently decrease body fluid volumes [5, 9, 10]. 

A limitation of this study was that the treatment period was relatively short compared with previous studies of canagliflozin and the comparatively small sample size of female subjects (11 females vs 50 males). Studies with longer treatment periods and more female cases are required to address the effect of canagliflozin on body fluid volume."
66,6161332,2018,Diabetes technology & therapeutics,Effect of Canagliflozin on Urinary Albumin Excretion in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Microalbuminuria: A Pilot Study.,"The development of albuminuria not only characterizes the progression of kidney injury3,4 but it can also predict cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM.25 Therefore, the guidelines recommended the regular assessment of albuminuria and reducing albuminuria in patients with T2DM.26,27 However, many patients with T2DM worldwide, including Japan, have substantial residual albuminuria and continue to progress toward ESKD. Thus, additional treatment complementing the existing therapies remains an important unmet medical need. The present pilot study showed that 12 weeks of treatment with canagliflozin significantly reduced 24-h urinary albumin excretion in Japanese patients with T2DM and microalbuminuria. 

In the present study, canagliflozin reduced 24-h urinary albumin excretion by 42%. A similar magnitude of reduction in albuminuria was previously reported following canagliflozin treatment in Western patients with T2DM.20 Furthermore, consistent with the results of previous non-Japanese studies,28–30 the changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, and body weight did not correlate with the albuminuria response during canagliflozin treatment. Thus, canagliflozin appears to reduce urinary albumin excretion in patients with T2DM without racial differences. 

We also observed that the levels of urinary transferrin were reduced after 12 weeks of treatment with canagliflozin. Transferrin is a biomarker for glomerular damage. Furthermore, it is well known that urinary transferrin showed a high correlation with urinary albumin.31 Taken together, the amelioration of damaged glomerular function in these patients is suggested. In addition to glomerular damage, recent studies have also shown the involvement of tubular damage during the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.32,33 However, the tubular damage markers evaluated in this study were all within the reference ranges both at baseline and at week 12. There was a small decrease in urinary L-FABP level, which reflected the mitigation of proximal tubular stress presumably via reducing the amount of work required following canagliflozin treatment.34–36 Even though this could increase albumin reabsorption, it is unlikely that increased tubular albumin reabsorption plays a major role in the reduced level of urinary albumin excretion. 

In this study, eGFR was lower following 12 weeks of canagliflozin treatment. Previous investigations on SGLT2 inhibitors, including canagliflozin, putatively by activated tubuloglomerular feedback,37 showed an acute decline in eGFR followed by a period of maintained kidney function.20,29,38,39 A similar reduction in eGFR was reported with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors,40–42 and this would suggest that an intraglomerular hemodynamic effect, including the alleviation of glomerular hypertension, contributes to the reduction of albuminuria.43,44 In addition, the activation of inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress has been shown in the kidneys of patients with diabetic nephropathy,45,46 and is estimated to be a factor that initiates and sustains disease progression. However, the inflammatory biomarkers measured in this study were not suppressed and circulating TNFR2 levels slightly increased after canagliflozin treatment. Intriguingly, urinary levels of the oxidative stress marker 8-OHdG were reduced after treatment with canagliflozin. Moreover, hematocrit was elevated after treatment with canagliflozin, which is expected to deliver more oxygen to tissues to reduce ischemic stress.34,35 However, we did not observe any association between changes in 24-h urinary albumin excretion and either of the abovementioned variables, including eGFR, 8-OHdG, and hematocrit. Although the change in plasma renin activity was significantly correlated with change in urinary albumin, we could not conclude that it was a real finding, because the correlation was driven almost exclusively by a single subject with a very large decrease in 24-h urinary albumin and no clear trend was observed in the rest of the subjects. As the present study cannot provide conclusive evidence for the precise mechanism involved, we must assume that multiple characteristics of the drug could be involved in reducing albuminuria. 

There were two AEs, and no serious AEs, reported during the treatment period. In a previous study in patients with T2DM and stage 3 chronic kidney disease (eGFR: 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2), genital mycotic infections and volume depletion-related AEs were frequently observed in the canagliflozin-treated group (number of patients/number of participants [event rate]: 51/703 [7.3%] and 48/703 [6.8%], respectively) than placebo group (6/382 [1.6%] and 10/382 [2.6%], respectively),47 and some reports have warned that SGLT2 inhibitors could induce acute kidney injury.48,49 However, no volume depletion- or renal-related AEs were reported in our present short-term study, and no novel safety concerns were raised. 

There are some limitations to this study that should be taken into consideration. The study was performed in a single-site, single-arm, and open-label manner, sample size was relatively small, and the study follow-up period was only 12 weeks. The results generated by the present study, therefore, warrant randomized-controlled, multicenter trials with a sufficiently large number of participants and a longer treatment period for fully confirming the renoprotective effects and for delineating the mechanism of action. Definitive evidence of the renoprotective effects of canagliflozin is expected to be provided by the following ongoing studies: Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation Study (CREDENCE; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02065791) and Effect of Canagliflozin in Type 2 Diabetic Patients with Microalbuminuria in Japanese Population (CANPIONE; UMIN trial ID: UMIN000029905)."
67,6667918,2019,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",CANadian CAnagliflozin REgistry: Effectiveness and safety of canagliflozin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Canadian clinical practice.,"In this prospective, multicentre study of SGLT2‐naïve patients with T2DM, conducted in the context of usual Canadian clinical practices, CANA significantly lowered HbA1c from baseline at 6 and 12 months (mean changes of −0.90% and − 1.06%, respectively), regardless of the duration of diabetes or of combination treatment regimens involving other AHAs. Greater reductions in HbA1c were seen among the patients receiving CANA who had higher baseline HbA1c values. Overall, at Month 12, 38.8% of patients achieved the HbA1c target of <7.0% and 72% of patients achieved a reduction in HbA1c of ≥0.5%. Notably, 53% of patients with low HbA1c at baseline (7.0%‐7.4%) achieved more than a half‐point in HbA1c reduction. HbA1c reductions are more difficult to achieve in such patients compared to those with higher HbA1c levels, suggesting that CANA decreases HbA1c, even in patients with relatively low levels of hyperglycaemia.

Body weight, BMI and waist circumference were markedly reduced over time with use of CANA in this real‐world study, which is consistent with published literature documenting the effects of CANA on body weight and modulation of visceral fat.24 Abdominal or visceral adiposity is recognized as an independent predictor of metabolic and CV comorbidities.25 Clinical studies concerning weight loss have shown the positive impact of weight reduction on lower cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids, BP and inflammatory markers.26, 27 Findings from the STENO‐2 study emphasized the importance of focusing on multifactorial risk reduction in T2DM management, on reduction of CV disease and renal impairment, as well as on improvement in treatment compliance in T2DM patients.28, 29 Glycaemic control, weight loss and SBP reduction are known to markedly lower modifiable metabolic and CV‐related risk factors, and are recognized as valid composite endpoints in assessing T2DM management.30, 31, 32 In addition, changes in anthropometric measures are important and relevant to patients, and they have been associated with improvements in patient adherence to medication.33, 34 Over the 12‐month study period, 40% of patients achieved the double composite endpoint and approximately 25% of patients achieved triple target control (Figure ​(Figure33(B),(C)).

Findings of the CanCARE study suggest that, in usual practice in Canada, CANA may facilitate achievement of multifactorial risk reduction (glycaemic, weight and BP goals) in patients with T2DM as adjunct therapy to multiple AHA regimens, including oral and injectable agents.

Consistent with the safety findings observed in CANA clinical trials,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 the overall incidence of AEs was low, with most being either mild or moderate in severity. The vast majority of GMI and polyuria events occurred during the first 3 months after initiation of CANA treatment (Figure S2) and declined over time in both men and women, similar to findings from Phase 3 clinical trials.35 The study discontinuation rate associated with AEs was approximately 10%, with the most frequent reasons cited being genital fungal infection and polyuria (Table ​(Table2).2). The recent Diabetes Canada 2018 clinical practice guidelines underscore the importance of avoiding weight gain and hypoglycaemia with treatment selection in the management of T2DM.10 Hypoglycaemia is a potential side effect of antihyperglycaemic therapies, particularly therapy with insulin and sulfonylureas, and is recognized as a major clinical consequence associated with falls, fractures and traffic accidents; it has also proven to be traumatic by causing fear, stress and anxiety for both the T2DM patient and the caregiver.36, 37

The observed renal threshold for glucose (RTG) values with CANA treatment are above the usual threshold for hypoglycaemia (≤70.0 mg/dL or 3.9 mmol/L), a level above the plasma glucose concentration at which hypoglycaemic symptoms occur.38 In our study, irrespective of different background AHA regimens (mono, dual or triple therapy, and in combination with insulin or other AHAs), the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was very low (<1%) and occurred mainly in patients using insulin. This finding is in line with the clinical trial data available for CANA, in which hypoglycaemia was reported infrequently, and at rates similar to report rates for study comparator drugs.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

A potential limitation of this prospective, observational registry is the open‐label study design, which may have introduced selection bias related to the inclusion of patients who would most likely benefit from the CANA treatment. The lack of a control group is another limitation of the study; however, the findings from the current study supplement the growing body of evidence concerning significant real‐world outcomes with CANA.

In conclusion, the CanCARE study demonstrated that CANA treatment was effective in optimal management of T2DM patients in real‐world clinical practices in Canada. Following CANA initiation, significant mean reductions in HbA1c were observed at 6 and 12 months, and statistically significant improvements were noted in weight, waist circumference and BP. The efficacious improvement in cardiometabolic parameters with CANA that was observed in this real‐world evidence study, confirms results from Phase 3 randomized controlled trials. CANA was well tolerated in T2DM patients, with a low incidence of reported AEs, a low incidence of hypoglycaemia and a high rate of persistence. These findings support the effectiveness and safety of CANA as a viable treatment option in Canadian clinical practice when administered either as monotherapy or in combination with other AHAs."
