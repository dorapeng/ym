1,29954951,2018,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",SGLT2 inhibition and kidney protection.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing public health concern worldwide. Numerous drug classes are available for treatment, however, their efficacy with regard to diabetes-induced renal and cardiovascular (CV) complications remains limited. Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) are a new class of blood glucose lowering medications that block renal glucose reabsorption and have protective effects on the kidney and the heart. This review focusses on the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the kidney and renal outcome: it briefly outlines renal glucose handling in diabetes and its role in glomerular hyperfiltration and renal hypoxia; describes how SGLT2 inhibitors induce an early, reversible reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and preserve GFR in the long-term in patients with T2DM; discusses whether the enhanced active transport in the renal outer medulla (OM) in response to SGLT2 inhibition is friend or foe; proposes how the blood pressure lowering and heart failure protective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors can be preserved in chronic kidney disease (CKD) despite attenuated antihyperglycemic effects; and examines whether SGLT2 inhibition enhances the incidence or severity of acute kidney injury (AKI)."
2,32003833,2020,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future?,"The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major advance for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial have clearly demonstrated that canagliflozin prevents kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The results from three other large-scale randomized trials, collectively enrolling >30 000 participants, have provided further evidence that the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on major kidney outcomes in people with T2DM may be present across the class, although this will only be known for certain when Dapagliflozin and Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with CKD (DAPA-CKD) (NCT03036150) and The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) (NCT03594110) are reported over coming years. Importantly, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition have been achieved in addition to the current standard of care. This review summarizes evidence for SGLT2 inhibition in people with T2DM and CKD, evaluates key patient characteristics and concomitant drug use that may influence the use of these drugs in people with CKD, discusses current guideline recommendations and explores how these drugs may be used in people with CKD in the future, including in combination with other treatments."
3,32590982,2020,Cardiovascular diabetology,SGLT2i: beyond the glucose-lowering effect.,"Sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new type of glucose-lowering drug that can reduce blood glucose by inhibiting its reabsorption in proximal tubules and by promoting urinary glucose excretion. SGLT2i are widely used in the clinical treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In recent studies, SGLT2i were found to not only reduce blood glucose but also protect the heart and kidney, which can significantly reduce cardiovascular events, delay the progression of renal failure, greatly improve the quality of life of patients, and reduce medical expenses for families and society. As adverse cardiac and renal events are the most common and serious complications of T2DM, it is very important to understand the cardio- and renoprotective mechanisms of SGLT2i. This article reviews the historical development, pharmacological mechanism, heart and kidney protection and safety of SGLT2i. The information presented provides a theoretical basis for the clinical prevention and treatment of diabetes and its complications and for the development of new glucose-lowering drugs."
4,27296042,2017,Current diabetes reviews,Empagliflozin for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: An Overview of Phase 3 Clinical Trials.,"Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have a unique mechanism of action leading to excretion of glucose in the urine and subsequent lowering of plasma glucose. This mechanism is independent of β-cell function; thus, these agents are effective treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at theoretically any disease stage. This class should not confer an additional risk of hypoglycemia (unless combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue) and has the potential to be combined with other classes of glucose-lowering agents. Empagliflozin is one of three currently approved SGLT2 inhibitors in the United States, and has shown a favorable benefit-risk ratio in phase 3 clinical trials as monotherapy and as add-on to other glucose-lowering therapy in broad patient populations. In addition to its glucose-lowering effects, empagliflozin has been shown to reduce body weight and blood pressure without a compensatory increase in heart rate. Moreover, on top of standard of care, empagliflozin is the first glucoselowering agent to demonstrate cardiovascular risk reduction in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease in a prospective outcomes trial: a 14% reduction in risk of the 3-point composite endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Like other SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin is associated with a higher rate of genital mycotic infections than placebo and has the potential for volume depletion-associated events. This review summarizes the empagliflozin phase 3 clinical trials program and its potential significance in the treatment of patients with T2DM. Evidence from these clinical trials show reductions in glycated hemoglobin (-0.59 to -0.82%) with a low risk of hypoglycemia except when used with insulin or insulin secretagogues, and moderate reductions in body weight (-2.1 to - 2.5 kg) and systolic blood pressure (-2.9 to -5.2 mm Hg), thus supporting the use of empagliflozin as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering agents. In addition, evidence from the recent EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, which demonstrated relative risk reductions in major adverse cardiac events (14%), cardiovascular mortality (38%) and all-cause mortality (32%), as well as hospitalization for heart failure (36%), supports use of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM and increased cardiovascular risk."
5,27822054,2016,Vascular health and risk management,Impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on blood pressure.,"SGLT2 inhibitors are glucose-lowering agents used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These agents target the kidney to promote urinary glucose excretion, resulting in improved blood glucose control. SGLT2-inhibitor therapy is also associated with weight loss and blood pressure (BP) lowering. Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with T2DM, and is associated with excess morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes data on the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors marketed in the US (namely canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin) on BP in patients with T2DM. Boolean searches were conducted that included terms related to BP or hypertension with terms for SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin using PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar. Data from numerous randomized controlled trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM demonstrated clinically relevant reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP, assessed via seated office measurements and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. Observed BP lowering was not associated with compensatory increases in heart rate. Circadian BP rhythm was also maintained. The mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated BP reduction is not fully understood, but is assumed to be related to osmotic diuresis and natriuresis. Other factors that may also contribute to BP reduction include SGLT2 inhibitor-associated decreases in body weight and reduced arterial stiffness. Local inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system secondary to increased delivery of sodium to the juxtaglomerular apparatus during SGLT2 inhibition has also been postulated. Although SGLT2 inhibitors are not indicated as BP-lowering agents, the modest decreases in systolic and diastolic BP observed with SGLT2 inhibitors may provide an extra clinical advantage for the majority of patients with T2DM, in addition to improving blood glucose control."

This study examined the real-world comparative effectiveness within the SGLT2i class and compared with non-SGLT2i antihyperglycaemic agents. Data from 4 large US administrative claims databases were used to characterize risk and provide population-level estimates of canagliflozin's effects on hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and BKLE amputation vs other SGLT2i and non-SGLT2i in T2DM patients. Comparative analyses using a propensity score-adjusted new-user cohort design examined relative hazards of outcomes across all new users and a subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease. Across the 4 databases (142 800 new users of canagliflozin, 110 897 new users of other SGLT2i, 460 885 new users of non-SGLT2i), the meta-analytic hazard ratio estimate for HHF with canagliflozin vs non-SGLT2i was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.26-0.60) in the on-treatment analysis. The estimate for BKLE amputation with canagliflozin vs non-SGLT2i was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.40-1.41) in the on-treatment analysis and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.93-1.10) in the intent-to-treat analysis. Effects in the subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease were similar for both outcomes. No consistent differences were observed between canagliflozin and other SGLT2i. In this large comprehensive analysis, canagliflozin and other SGLT2i demonstrated HHF benefits consistent with clinical trial data, but showed no increased risk of BKLE amputation vs non-SGLT2i. HHF and BKLE amputation results were similar in the subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease. This study helps further characterize the potential benefits and harms of SGLT2i in routine clinical practice to complement evidence from clinical trials and prior observational studies."
7,30296931,2018,Cardiovascular diabetology,Impact of dapagliflozin on left ventricular diastolic function of patients with type 2 diabetic mellitus with chronic heart failure.,"The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with heart failure (HF). This trial was a prospective multicenter study of 58 T2DM patients with stable HF at five institutions in Japan. Patients who had been taking at least one antidiabetic drugs other than SGLT2 inhibitors started the administration of 5 mg/day of dapagliflozin. The physical examinations, blood tests, and echocardiography were performed at baseline and 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin. The primary endpoint was defined as a change in mitral inflow E and mitral e' annular velocities (E/e') between baseline and 6 months after the administration of dapagliflozin. The secondary end points consisted of a change in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), LV mass index (LVMI) and left atrial volume index (LAVI). E/e' significantly decreased from 9.3 to 8.5 cm/s (p = 0.020) 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin. LAVI and LVMI significantly decreased from 31 to 26 mL/m<sup>2</sup> (p = 0.001), and from 75.0 to 67.0 g/m<sup>2</sup> (p < 0.001), respectively, 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin. No significant change was observed in BNP (from 27.9 to 28.9 pg/mL; p = 0.132) 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin, except for a significant decrease from 168.8 to 114.3 pg/mL (p = 0.012) in patients with BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL. This prospective multicenter trial showed the beneficial effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on LV diastolic functional parameters for T2DM patients with HF. Our findings may thus offer a new insight into the management of T2DM patients.

8,31138195,2019,Cardiovascular diabetology,The CANVAS Program: implications of canagliflozin on reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that reduces blood glucose, as well as blood pressure, body weight, and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program, patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk treated with canagliflozin had a significantly lower risk of the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; hospitalization for heart failure; and renal outcomes, but also a greater risk of lower-limb amputation. Cardiovascular outcomes trials of some other T2DM agents (i.e., empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, liraglutide, semaglutide, albiglutide) have also shown potential cardiovascular and renal benefits. As a result, diabetes treatment guidelines have begun to incorporate consideration of cardiovascular and renal benefits into their treatment recommendations. Antihyperglycemic agents with proven beneficial cardiovascular effects represent a new opportunity for the diabetologist and cardiologist, in the setting of a multidisciplinary approach, to concomitantly improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM. This review briefly discusses the pharmacology of canagliflozin, including clinical and preclinical data; it also describes the effects of canagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes and side-effects, and compares these effects with other glucose-lowering agents with proven cardiovascular benefits."
9,31264765,2019,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and multiple cardiovascular risk factors: An Asian perspective and expert recommendations.,"Diabetes mellitus in Asia accounts for more than half of the global prevalence. There is a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the region among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and it is often associated with multiple risk factors including hypertension, renal disease and obesity. The early onset of T2DM and the eventual long disease duration portends an increasing proportion of the population to premature CVD. In addition to lowering blood glucose, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors exert favourable effects on multiple risk factors (including blood pressure, body weight and renal function) and provide an opportunity to reduce the risk of CVD in patients with T2DM. In this article, we consolidated the existing literature on SGLT-2 inhibitor use in Asian patients with T2DM and established contemporary guidance for clinicians. We extensively reviewed recommendations from international and regional guidelines, published data from clinical trials in the Asian population (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, ipragliflozin, luseogliflozin and tofogliflozin), CVD outcomes trials (EMPAREG-OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE-TIMI 58) and real-world evidence studies (CVD-REAL, EASEL, CVD-REAL 2 and OBSERVE-4D). A series of clinical recommendations on the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in Asian patients with T2DM was deliberated among experts with multiple rounds of review and voting. Based on the available evidence, we conclude that SGLT-2 inhibitors represent an evidence-based therapeutic option for the primary prevention of heart failure hospitalization and secondary prevention of CVD in patients with T2DM, and should be considered early on in the treatment algorithm for patients with multiple risk factors, or those with established CVD."
10,31474116,2019,Circulation,Heart Failure Risk Stratification and Efficacy of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at increased risk of developing heart failure. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in patients with T2DM. We aimed to develop and validate a practical clinical risk score for HHF in patients with T2DM and assess whether this score can identify high-risk patients with T2DM who have the greatest reduction in risk for HHF with a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. We developed a clinical risk score for HHF in 8212 patients with T2DM in the placebo arm of SAVOR-TIMI 53 (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53). Candidate variables were assessed using multivariable Cox regression, and independent clinical risk indicators achieving statistical significance of <i>P</i><0.001 were included in the risk score. We externally validated the score in 8578 patients with T2DM in the placebo arm of DECLARE-TIMI 58 (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58). The relative and absolute risk reductions in HHF with the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin were assessed by baseline HHF risk. Five clinical variables were independent risk predictors of HHF: prior heart failure, history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A simple integer-based score (0-7 points) using these predictors identified a >20-fold gradient of HHF risk (<i>P</i> for trend <0.001) in both the derivation and validation cohorts, with C indices of 0.81 and 0.78, respectively. Although relative risk reductions with dapagliflozin were similar for patients across the risk scores (25%-34%), absolute risk reductions were greater in those at higher baseline risk (1-sided <i>P</i> for trend=0.04), with high-risk (2 points) and very-high-risk (≥3 points) patients having 1.5% and 2.7% absolute reductions in Kaplan-Meier estimates of HHF risk at 4 years, respectively. Risk stratification using a novel clinical risk score for HHF in patients with T2DM identifies patients at higher risk for HHF who derive greater absolute benefit from sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition.

11,31530577,2019,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,Effect of Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes across Different Levels of Albuminuria: Data from the CANVAS Program.,"If SGLT2 inhibitors protect the kidneys by reducing albuminuria as hypothesized, people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with higher albuminuria should benefit more. We conducted a <i>post-hoc</i> analysis of data from the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program, which randomized 10,142 participants with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk to canagliflozin or placebo. We assessed effects of canagliflozin on renal, cardiovascular, and safety outcomes by baseline albuminuria. The trial included 2266 participants (22.3%) with moderately increased albuminuria (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio [UACR] 30-300 mg/g) and 760 (7.5%) with severely increased albuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g) at baseline. Canagliflozin lowered albuminuria with greater proportional reductions in those with moderately and severely increased albuminuria (<i>P</i> heterogeneity<0.001). After week 13, canagliflozin slowed the annual loss of kidney function across albuminuria subgroups, with greater absolute reductions in participants with severely increased albuminuria (placebo-subtracted difference 3.01 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> per year; <i>P</i> heterogeneity<0.001). Heterogeneity for the renal composite outcome of 40% reduction in eGFR, ESKD, or renal-related death was driven by lesser effects in participants with moderately increased albuminuria (<i>P</i> heterogeneity=0.03), but no effect modification was observed when albuminuria was fitted as a continuous variable (<i>P</i> heterogeneity=0.94). Cardiovascular and safety outcomes were mostly consistent across albuminuria levels including increased risks for amputation across albuminuria subgroups (<i>P</i> heterogeneity=0.66). Greater absolute risk reductions in the renal composite outcome were observed in participants with severely increased albuminuria (<i>P</i> heterogeneity=0.004). The proportional effects of canagliflozin on renal and cardiovascular outcomes are mostly consistent across patients with different levels of albuminuria, but absolute benefits are greatest among those with severely increased albuminuria."
12,31757028,2019,International journal of molecular sciences,Renal Benefits of SGLT 2 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Receptor Agonists: Evidence Supporting a Paradigm Shift in the Medical Management of Type 2 Diabetes.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most perilous side effects of diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2 (T1DM and T2DM).). It is known that sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT 2i) and glucagone like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have renoprotective effects, but the molecular mechanisms are still unknown. In clinical trials GLP-1 analogs exerted important impact on renal composite outcomes, primarily on macroalbuminuria, possibly through suppression of inflammation-related pathways, however enhancement of natriuresis and diuresis is also one of possible mechanisms of nephroprotection. Dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin are SGLT2i drugs, useful in reducing hyperglycemia and in their potential renoprotective mechanisms, which include blood pressure control, body weight loss, intraglomerular pressure reduction, and a decrease in urinary proximal tubular injury biomarkers. In this review we have discussed the potential synergistic and/or additive effects of GLP 1 RA and SGLT2 inhibitors on the primary onset and progression of kidney disease, and the potential implications on current guidelines of diabetes type 2 management."
13,26936519,2016,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Dapagliflozin reduces albuminuria in patients with diabetes and hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin blockers.,"To characterize the effect of dapagliflozin on albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and to determine whether effects on albuminuria were mediated through changes in glycated haemoblogin (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), body weight or eGFR. We conducted a post hoc analysis of data pooled from two phase III clinical trials in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on stable angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy, randomly assigned to dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or matched placebo. This analysis included only patients with microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria at baseline. Patients were randomized to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg (n = 167) or placebo (n = 189). Dapagliflozin resulted in greater 12-week reductions in albuminuria compared with placebo: -33.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) -45.4, -18.2]. The reduction in albuminuria was also present after adjusting for age, sex and changes in HbA1c, SBP, body weight and eGFR: -23.5% (95% CI -37.6, -6.3). There was a decrease in eGFR with dapagliflozin versus placebo that was readily reversed 1 week after last dose. No serious renal-related adverse events were observed in any group. Dapagliflozin was effective in lowering albuminuria in patients with T2DM and hypertension using renin-angiotensin system blockade therapy. Reductions in albuminuria were still present after adjusting for changes in HbA1c, SBP, body weight and eGFR. Dapagliflozin-induced improvements in glycaemic control and reductions in SBP, coupled with other potentially beneficial renal effects, may lead to a reduced long-term renal and cardiovascular risk."
14,27208375,2016,Diabetes care,SGLT2 Inhibitors and Cardiovascular Risk: Lessons Learned From the EMPA-REG OUTCOME Study.,"Although cardiovascular (CV) mortality is the principal cause of death in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), reduction of plasma glucose concentration has little effect on CV disease (CVD) risk. Thus, novel strategies to reduce CVD risk in T2DM patients are needed. The recently published BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study demonstrated that in T2DM patients with high CVD risk empagliflozin reduced the primary major adverse cardiac event end point (CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke) by 14%. This beneficial effect was driven by a 38% reduction in CV mortality with no significant decrease in nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke. Empagliflozin also caused a 35% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure without affecting hospitalization for unstable angina. Although sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors exert multiple metabolic benefits (decreases in HbA1c, body weight, and blood pressure and an increase in HDL cholesterol), all of which could reduce CVD risk, it is unlikely that the reduction in CV mortality can be explained by empagliflozin's metabolic effects. More likely, hemodynamic effects, specifically reduced blood pressure and decreased extracellular volume, are responsible for the reduction in CV mortality and heart failure hospitalization. In this Perspective, we will discuss possible mechanisms for these beneficial effects of empagliflozin and their implications for the care of T2DM patients."

Data were pooled from 13 placebo-controlled trials of up to 24 weeks' duration (dapagliflozin, n = 2360; placebo, n = 2295). Larger placebo-/comparator-controlled pools of 21 (≤208 weeks; dapagliflozin, n = 5936; control, n = 3403) and 30 trials (≥12 weeks; dapagliflozin, n = 9195; control, n = 4629) assessed the rare adverse events (AEs) of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and lower limb amputation, respectively. Over 24 weeks, the overall incidence of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) was similar for dapagliflozin and placebo: 60.0% vs 55.7% and 5.1% vs 5.4%, respectively. Rates of hypoglycaemia, volume depletion AEs, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and fractures were balanced between the groups. Genital infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin (5.5%) vs placebo (0.6%) and renal function AEs occurred in 3.2% vs 1.8% of patients (the most common renal AE was decreased creatinine clearance: 1.1% vs 0.7%). In the 21-study pool, 1 SAE of DKA and 3 AEs of ketonuria/metabolic acidosis occurred with dapagliflozin vs none with control; estimated combined incidence for these events was 0.03% (95% confidence interval 0.010-0.089). In the 30-study pool, lower limb amputation occurred in 8 (0.1%) and 7 (0.2%) patients receiving dapagliflozin and control, respectively. The overall incidence rates of AEs and SAEs were similar in the dapagliflozin and placebo/control groups, including the incidence of hypoglycaemia, volume depletion, fractures, UTIs, amputations and DKA. Genital infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin than placebo."

It has recently been shown that the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors leads to a reduction in CV outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including mortality and heart failure hospitalization. The exact mechanisms of how SGLT2 inhibitors lead to this CV risk reduction remain incompletely understood. The study of DAPAgliflozin on CARDiac substrate uptake, myocardial efficiency and myocardial contractile work in type 2 diabetes patients (DAPACARD) (NCT03387683) explores the possible effects of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, on cardiac work, metabolism, and biomarker levels. DAPACARD is an international, randomized, double-blind trial that aims to examine the effects of dapagliflozin versus matching placebo in 52 patients with T2DM that are on stable metformin therapy prior to and during the 6 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint is change in global longitudinal strain of the left ventricle (GLSLV) measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between baseline (pre-treatment) and end of study (on-treatment). The secondary endpoint is the corresponding change in myocardial efficiency measured as external left ventricular work divided by total left ventricular work, which is estimated using [11C]-acetate clearance using positron emission tomography (PET). The DAPACARD study is an extensive investigation of cardiac function and metabolism, by advanced imaging with PET and MRI, as well as biomarkers, performed in order to further explore how the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin could influence cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM."
17,30793549,2019,Diabetes & metabolism journal,"Update on the Impact, Diagnosis and Management of Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy in Diabetes: What Is Defined, What Is New, and What Is Unmet.","The burden of diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is expected to increase due to the diabetes epidemic and its early and widespread appearance. CAN has a definite prognostic role for mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. Putative mechanisms for this are tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, orthostatic hypotension, reverse dipping, and impaired heart rate variability, while emerging mechanisms like inflammation support the pervasiveness of autonomic dysfunction. Efforts to overcome CAN under-diagnosis are on the table: by promoting screening for symptoms and signs; by simplifying cardiovascular reflex tests; and by selecting the candidates for screening. CAN assessment allows for treatment of its manifestations, cardiovascular risk stratification, and tailoring therapeutic targets. Risk factors for CAN are mainly glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and, in addition, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and obesity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while preliminary data regard glycaemic variability, vitamin B12 and D changes, oxidative stress, inflammation, and genetic biomarkers. Glycaemic control prevents CAN in T1DM, whereas multifactorial intervention might be effective in T2DM. Lifestyle intervention improves autonomic function mostly in pre-diabetes. While there is no conclusive evidence for a disease-modifying therapy, treatment of CAN manifestations is available. The modulation of autonomic function by SGLT2i represents a promising research field with possible clinical relevance."

After randomisation, participants will receive the study drug for 12 weeks in addition to their background therapy. The primary endpoint is the proportional change in baseline BNP after 12 weeks of treatment. The key secondary endpoints are the change from baseline in the ratio of early mitral inflow velocity to mitral annular early diastolic velocity, body weight and glycaemic control after 12 weeks of treatment. The study has been approved by the ethics committee and the patients will be included after informed consent. The results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. UMIN000018395."
19,31910853,2020,Cardiovascular diabetology,Positive effect of dapagliflozin on left ventricular longitudinal function for type 2 diabetic mellitus patients with chronic heart failure.,"The effect of sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor on left ventricular (LV) longitudinal myocardial function in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with heart failure (HF) has remained unclear. We analyzed data from our previous prospective multicenter study, in which we investigated the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on LV diastolic functional parameters of T2DM patients with stable HF at five institutions in Japan. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin. LV diastolic function was defined as the ratio of mitral inflow E to mitral e' annular velocities (E/e'). LV longitudinal myocardial function was assessed as global longitudinal strain (GLS), which in turn was determined as the averaged peak longitudinal strain from standard LV apical views. E/e' significantly decreased from 9.3 to 8.5 cm/s 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin (p = 0.020) as previously described, while GLS showed significant improvement from 15.5 ± 3.5% to 16.9 ± 4.1% (p < 0.01) 6 months after administration of dapagliflozin. Furthermore, improvement of GLS in HF with preserved ejection fraction patients was more significant from 17.0 ± 1.9% to 18.7 ± 2.0% (p < 0.001), compared to that in HF with mid-range ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction patients from 14.4 ± 2.4% to 15.5 ± 1.8% (p = 0.06) and from 8.1 ± 1.5% to 7.8 ± 2.1% (p = 0.44), respectively. It was noteworthy that multiple regression analysis showed that the change in GLS after administration of dapagliflozin was the only independent determinant parameters for the change in E/e' after administration of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin was found to be associated with improvement of LV longitudinal myocardial function, which led to further improvement of LV diastolic function of T2DM patients with stable HF. GLS-guided management may thus lead to improved management of T2DM patients with stable HF."
20,31969144,2020,Cardiovascular diabetology,Effects of antidiabetic drugs on left ventricular function/dysfunction: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Although a variety of antidiabetic drugs have significant protective action on the cardiovascular system, it is still unclear which antidiabetic drugs can improve ventricular remodeling and fundamentally delay the process of heart failure. The purpose of this network meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, metformin (MET), sulfonylurea (SU) and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in improving left ventricular (LV) remodeling in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD). We searched articles published before October 18, 2019, regardless of language or data, in 4 electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. We included randomized controlled trials in this network meta-analysis, as well as a small number of cohort studies. The differences in the mean changes in left ventricular echocardiographic parameters between the treatment group and control group were evaluated. The difference in the mean change in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) between GLP-1 agonists and placebo in treatment effect was greater than zero (MD = 2.04% [0.64%, 3.43%]); similar results were observed for the difference in the mean change in LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) between SGLT-2 inhibitors and placebo (MD = - 3.3 mm [5.31, - 5.29]), the difference in the mean change in LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) between GLP-1 agonists and placebo (MD = - 4.39 ml [- 8.09, - 0.7]); the difference in the mean change in E/e' between GLP-1 agonists and placebo (MD = - 1.05[- 1.78, - 0.32]); and the difference in the mean change in E/e' between SGLT-2 inhibitors and placebo (MD = - 1.91[- 3.39, - 0.43]). GLP-1 agonists are more significantly associated with improved LVEF, LVESV and E/e', SGLT-2 inhibitors are more significantly associated with improved LVEDD and E/e', and DPP-4 inhibitors are more strongly associated with a negative impact on LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) than are placebos. SGLT-2 inhibitors are superior to other drugs in pairwise comparisons."
21,25589482,2015,Diabetes & vascular disease research,SGLT-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk: proposed pathways and review of ongoing outcome trials.,"Given the multi-faceted pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it is likely that interventions to mitigate this risk must address cardiovascular (CV) risk factors beyond glucose itself. Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are newer antihyperglycaemic agents with apparent multiple effects. Inherent in their mode of action to decrease glucose reabsorption by the kidneys by increasing urinary glucose excretion, these agents improve glycaemic control independent of insulin secretion with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. In this review, we outline those CV risk factors that this class appears to influence and provide the design features and trial characteristics of six ongoing outcome trials involving more than 41,000 individuals with T2DM. Those risk factors beyond glucose that can potentially be modulated positively with SGLT-2 inhibitors include blood pressure, weight, visceral adiposity, hyperinsulinaemia, arterial stiffness, albuminuria, circulating uric acid levels and oxidative stress. On the other hand, small increases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels have also been observed for the class, which theoretically might offset some of these benefits. The potential translational impact of these effects is being tested with outcome trials, also reviewed in this article, powered to assess both macrovascular as well as certain microvascular outcomes in T2DM. These are expected to begin to report in late 2015. "
22,25600248,2015,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Effect of canagliflozin on serum uric acid in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Hyperuricaemia is associated with an increased risk of gout, kidney stones and cardiovascular disease. The present post hoc analysis of pooled data from four placebo-controlled phase III studies assessed the effect of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, on serum uric acid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and in a subset of patients with hyperuricaemia [defined as baseline serum uric acid ≥475 µmol/l (∼8 mg/dl)]. At week 26, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg were associated with a ∼13% reduction in serum uric acid compared with placebo. In the subset of patients with hyperuricaemia, placebo-subtracted percent reductions in serum uric acid were similar to those in the overall cohort. More patients in the hyperuricaemic group achieved a serum uric acid level of <360 µmol/l (∼6 mg/dl) with both canagliflozin 100 mg (23.5%) and 300 mg (32.4%) compared with placebo (3.1%). Incidences of gout and kidney stones were low and similar across groups. In conclusion, canagliflozin treatment decreased serum uric acid in patients with T2DM, including those with baseline hyperuricaemia. "
23,26125313,2015,Metabolic syndrome and related disorders,The Use of SGLT-2 Inhibitors in Type 2 Diabetes and Heart Failure.,"The concurrent management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic congestive heart failure presents several therapeutic challenges. Of concern is that insulin and insulin-sensitizing medications detrimentally ""flood"" the heart with energy-providing substrates, including fats and glucose. In this population, treatment of T2DM should focus on the reduction of increased substrate supply. Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, a new class of antidiabetic medication, operate via this principle by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney and subsequently releasing glucose through the urine. In this review, we begin with an examination of the mechanisms of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity in the heart. Then we analyze the potential role of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy in patients with concurrent T2DM and chronic heart failure. Based on the available evidence, SGLT-2 inhibitors are safe and can be recommended to treat T2DM in patients with chronic heart failure and intact renal function. Further studies are in progress to assess long-term survival benefits. "
24,26343814,2015,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Effects of empagliflozin on blood pressure and markers of arterial stiffness and vascular resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"To determine the effects of empagliflozin on blood pressure (BP) and markers of arterial stiffness and vascular resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from a phase III trial in patients with T2DM and hypertension receiving 12 weeks' empagliflozin and four phase III trials in patients with T2DM receiving 24 weeks' empagliflozin (cohort 1, n = 823; cohort 2, n = 2477). BP was measured using 24-h BP monitoring (cohort 1) or seated office measurements (cohort 2). Empagliflozin reduced systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP in both cohorts (p < 0.001 vs placebo), without increasing heart rate. Empagliflozin reduced pulse pressure (PP; adjusted mean difference vs placebo cohort 1: -2.3 mmHg; cohort 2: -2.3 mmHg), mean arterial pressure (MAP; cohort 1, -2.3 mmHg; cohort 2, -2.1 mmHg) and double product (cohort 1, -385 mmHg × bpm; cohort 2, -369 mmHg × bpm) all p < 0.001 vs placebo. There was a trend towards a reduction in the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) with empagliflozin in cohort 1 (p = 0.059 vs placebo). AASI was not measured in cohort 2. Subgroup analyses showed that there were greater reductions in PP with increasing baseline SBP in cohort 1 (p = 0.092). In cohort 2, greater reductions in MAP were achieved in patients with higher baseline SBP (p = 0.027) and greater reductions in PP were observed in older patients (p = 0.011). Empagliflozin reduced BP and had favourable effects on markers of arterial stiffness and vascular resistance."
25,28255241,2017,Vascular health and risk management,An evidence-based practice-oriented review focusing on canagliflozin in the management of type 2 diabetes.,"Caring for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has entered an era with many recent additions to the regimens used to clinically control their hyperglycemia. The most recent class of agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for T2DM is the sodium-glucose-linked transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which work principally in the proximal tubule of the kidney to block filtered glucose reabsorption. In the few years attending this new class arrival in the market, there has been a great deal of interest generated by the novel mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors and by recent large outcome trials suggesting benefit on important clinical outcomes such as death, cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression. In this review, we focus on canagliflozin, the first-in-class marketed SGLT2 inhibitor in the USA. In some cases, we included data from other SGLT2 inhibitors, such as outcomes in clinical trials, important insights on clinical features and benefits, and adverse effects. These agents represent a fundamentally different way of controlling blood glucose and for the first time in T2DM care to offer the opportunity to reduce glucose, blood pressure, and weight with effects sustained for at least 2 years. Important side effects include genital mycotic infections and the potential for orthostatic hypotension and rare instances of normoglycemic ketoacidosis. Active ongoing clinical trials promise to deepen our experience with the potential benefits, as well as the clinical risks attending the use of this new group of antidiabetic agents."

Pooled data were analyzed from patients with T2DM treated with placebo (N = 4203), empagliflozin 10 mg (N = 4221), or empagliflozin 25 mg (N = 4196) in 15 randomized phase I-III trials plus four extension studies. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed descriptively in participants who took at least one dose of study drug. AE incidence rates per 100 patient-years were calculated to adjust for differences in drug exposure between trials. Total exposure was 7369, 7782, and 7754 patient-years in the placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and 25 mg groups, respectively. The incidence of any AEs, severe AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation was no higher in participants treated with empagliflozin vs. placebo. Empagliflozin was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia vs. placebo, except in participants on background sulfonylurea. The incidence of events consistent with urinary tract infection was similar across treatment groups (8.7-9.5/100 patient-years). Events consistent with genital infection occurred more frequently in participants treated with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg (3.5 and 3.4/100 patient-years, respectively) than placebo (0.9/100 patient-years). The incidence of AEs consistent with volume depletion was similar across treatment groups (1.7-1.9/100 patient-years) but was higher with empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg vs. placebo in participants aged 75 years or older (3.2 and 3.0 vs. 2.3/100 patient-years, respectively). The rates of bone fractures, cancer events, renal AEs, venous thromboembolic events, hepatic injury, acute pancreatitis, lower limb amputations, and diabetic ketoacidosis were similar across treatment groups. This analysis of pooled safety data based on more than 15,000 patient-years' exposure supports a favorable benefit-risk profile of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM.

27,30580866,2018,Indian heart journal,Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition for the reduction of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients with diabetes mellitus.,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exhibit an increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Hyperglycemia itself contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and heart failure (HF) in these patients, but glucose-lowering strategies studied to date have had little or no impact on reducing CV risk, especially in patients with a long duration of T2DM and prevalent CV disease (CVD). Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are the new class of glucose-lowering medications that increase urinary glucose excretion, thus improving glycemic control, independent of insulin. The recently published CV outcome trial, Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), demonstrated that the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliﬂozin signiﬁcantly reduced the combined CV end point of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke vs. placebo in a population of patients with T2DM and prevalent atherosclerotic CVD. In addition, and quite unexpectedly, empagliﬂozin signiﬁcantly and robustly reduced the individual end points of CV death, overall mortality, and hospitalization for HF in this high-risk population. Several beneficial factors beyond glucose control, such as weight loss, lowering blood pressure, sodium depletion, renal hemodynamic effects, effects on myocardial energetics, and/or neurohormonal effects, have been seen with SGLT2 inhibition."
28,30921791,2019,American journal of nephrology,Canagliflozin Prevents Intrarenal Angiotensinogen Augmentation and Mitigates Kidney Injury and Hypertension in Mouse Model of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Hypertension and renal injury are common complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hyperglycemia stimulates renal proximal tubular angiotensinogen (AGT) expression via elevated oxidative stress contributing to the development of high blood pressure and diabetic nephropathy. The sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in proximal tubules is responsible for the majority of glucose reabsorption by renal tubules. We tested the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibition with canagliflozin (CANA) prevents intrarenal AGT augmentation and ameliorates kidney injury and hypertension in T2DM. We induced T2DM in New Zealand obese mice with a high fat diet (DM, 30% fat) with control mice receiving regular fat diet (ND, 4% fat). When DM mice exhibited > 350 mg/dL blood glucose levels, both DM- and ND-fed mice were treated with 10 mg/kg/day CANA or vehicle by oral gavage for 6 weeks. We evaluated intrarenal AGT, blood pressure, and the development of kidney injury. Systolic blood pressure in DM mice (133.9 ± 2.0 mm Hg) was normalized by CANA (113.9 ± 4.0 mm Hg). CANA treatment ameliorated hyperglycemia-associated augmentation of renal AGT mRNA (148 ± 21 copies/ng RNA in DM, and 90 ± 16 copies/ng RNA in DM + CANA) and protein levels as well as elevation of urinary 8-isoprostane levels. Tubular fibrosis in DM mice (3.4 ± 0.9-fold, fibrotic score, ratio to ND) was suppressed by CANA (0.9 ± 0.3-fold). Furthermore, CANA attenuated DM associated increased macrophage infiltration and cell proliferation in kidneys of DM mice. CANA prevents intrarenal AGT upregulation and oxidative stress and which may mitigate high blood pressure, renal tubular fibrosis, and renal inflammation in T2DM."

Teneligliptin is a potent, selective, and long-lasting DPP-4 inhibitor with a t<sub>½</sub> of approximately 24 h and unique pharmacokinetic properties: it is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), or excreted from the kidney in an unchanged form. Because of its multiple elimination pathways, dose adjustment is not needed in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and it is considered to have a low potential for drug-drug interactions. Clinical studies and postmarketing surveillance show that teneligliptin, administered as monotherapy and/or in combination with antihyperglycemic agents, is effective and well tolerated in T2DM patients, including in elderly patients and those with renal impairment. Furthermore, teneligliptin has antioxidative properties, which induce the antioxidant cascade, as well as ·OH scavenging properties. In addition, it has shown endothelial protective effects in several non-clinical and clinical studies. From its unique profile and clinical data, teneligliptin represents a potential therapeutic option in a wide variety of patients, including elderly diabetic patients and those with renal impairment. The fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet of teneligliptin and canagliflozin has been approved in Japan; this is the first FDC tablet of a DPP-4 inhibitor and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in Japan, and the third globally. The FDC tablet may also provide additional prescribing and adherence benefits."

The administration of SGLT2 inhibitor in T2DM patients with hypertension and a fluid retention tendency lowers the blood pressure and mitigates fluid retention. It also reduces the heart rate in T2DM patients with a fast heart rate. As an explanation for the multifaceted effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on hemodynamics, we hypothesize that these agents act on the inter-organ communication pathway, which modulates the sympathetic nerve activity to the cardiovascular system."

We conducted a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study. Eighty-six patients with T2DM, HbA1c 7.0-10.0%, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g creatinine (gCr) were enrolled, and 85 of these patients were administered add-on dapagliflozin for 24 weeks. The primary and key secondary endpoints were change from baseline in the natural logarithm of UACR over 24 weeks and change in home BP profile at week 24. Baseline median UACR was 181.5 mg/gCr (interquartile range 47.85, 638.0). Baseline morning, evening, and nocturnal home systolic/diastolic BP was 137.6/82.7 mmHg, 136.1/79.3 mmHg, and 125.4/74.1 mmHg, respectively. After 24 weeks, the logarithm of UACR decreased by 0.37 ± 0.73 (P < 0.001). In addition, changes in morning, evening, and nocturnal home BP from baseline were as follows: morning systolic/diastolic BP - 8.32 ± 11.42/- 4.18 ± 5.91 mmHg (both P < 0.001), evening systolic/diastolic BP - 9.57 ± 12.08/- 4.48 ± 6.45 mmHg (both P < 0.001), and nocturnal systolic/diastolic BP - 2.38 ± 7.82/- 1.17 ± 5.39 mmHg (P = 0.0079 for systolic BP, P = 0.0415 for diastolic BP). Furthermore, the reduction in UACR after 24 weeks significantly correlated with an improvement in home BP profile, but not with changes in other variables, including office BP. Multivariate linear regression analysis also revealed that the change in morning home systolic BP was a significant contributor to the change in log-UACR. In Japanese patients with T2DM and diabetic nephropathy, dapagliflozin significantly improved albuminuria levels and the home BP profile. Improved morning home systolic BP was associated with albuminuria reduction.

Herein, we aimed to assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors in a Southern Italy population of subjects affected by T2DM. 408 diabetic patients treated with one of the three SGLT-2 inhibitors currently available in Italy (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin), either alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs, were retrospectively assessed at baseline, during, and after 18 months of continuous therapy. Treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors resulted in a median decrease in HbA1c of 0.9%, with a percentage of decrement of 12 in relation to the baseline value, followed by a significant reduction (<i>P</i> < 0.001) in fasting plasma glucose. Variations in HbA1c occurred independently of the baseline clinical or biochemical characteristics. In addition, treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced body weight (<i>P</i> < 0.008) and decreased diastolic blood pressure (<i>P</i> = 0.004). With regard to safety outcomes, 66 patients out of 91 stopped SGLT-2 inhibitors during follow-up because of chronic or recurring genital infections, while the rest experienced other adverse events, such as urinary tract infections, polyuria, nausea, hypotension, dizziness, acute coronary event, worsening of glycemic control status, and rapid deterioration of renal function. In our patients' population, the glycometabolic effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors were durable and comparable to those observed in multicenter randomized controlled trials. This notwithstanding safety concerns must be raised regarding the frequent occurrence of genitourinary infections and the risk of a rapid decline of renal function in patients with evidence of volume depletion and/or receiving other medications which can adversely affect kidney function."
33,32015688,2020,International journal of biological sciences,Empagliflozin Attenuates Hyperuricemia by Upregulation of ABCG2 via AMPK/AKT/CREB Signaling Pathway in Type 2 Diabetic Mice.,"Hyperuricemia (HUA) is a metabolic disease characterized by elevated serum uric acid (SUA). Empagliflozin, a kind of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, has recently emerged as a new antidiabetic agent by facilitating glucose excretion in urine. Moreover, there was evidence of SUA reduction following treatment with empagliflozin in addition to glycaemic control, while the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate the potential mechanisms, the model of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with HUA was established by combination of peritoneal injection of potassium oxonate and intragastric administration of hypoxanthine in KK-Ay mice. A series of method such as RT-PCR, western blot, immunochemistry, immunofluorescence were conducted to explore the mechanism. Our results showed that empagliflozin significantly ameliorated the levels of SUA and blood glucose in T2DM mice with HUA. Furthermore, in both kidney and ileum, empagliflozin obviously promoted protein expression of uric acid (UA) transporter ABCG2, p-AMPK, p-AKT and p-CREB. The same trend was observed in human tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells. Additionally, through application of an AMPK inhibitor (Compound C), it was further confirmed empagliflozin exerted its anti-hyperuricemic effects in an AMPK dependent manner. Meanwhile, with the help of ChIP assay and luciferase reporter gene assay, we found that CREB further activated ABCG2 via binding to the promoter of ABCG2 to induce transcription. Taken together, our study demonstrated that empagliflozin treatment played an essential role in attenuating HUA by upregulation of ABCG2 via AMPK/AKT/CREB signaling pathway."

Currently metformin is considered the first line of defence, but many patients experience gastrointestinal adverse events, necessitating an alternative treatment approach. Established therapeutic classes, such as sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones, have some properties undesirable in individuals with T2DM, such as hypoglycaemia risk, weight gain and fluid retention, highlighting the need for newer agents with more favourable safety profiles that can be combined and used at all stages of T2DM. New treatment strategies have focused on both dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, which improve hyperglycaemia by stimulating insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent fashion and suppressing glucagon secretion, and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which reduce renal glucose reabsorption and induce urinary glucose excretion, thereby lowering plasma glucose. The potential complimentary mechanism of action and good tolerance profile of these two classes of agents make them attractive treatment options for combination therapy with any of the existing glucose-lowering agents, including insulin. Together, the DPP-4 and SGLT2 inhibitors fulfill a need for treatments with mechanisms of action that can be used in combination with a low risk of adverse events, such as hypoglycaemia or weight gain.

The mean lowest glucose concentrations (placebo vs. luseogliflozin, mg/dL) decreased to similar levels in the normal (115.4 vs. 93.4), normal-mild (121.0 vs. 97.9), and mild-moderate (104.0 vs. 91.1) groups. This post hoc subanalysis revealed that although mild-to-moderately reduced renal function attenuated the glucose-lowering effects of luseogliflozin on peak postprandial glucose, it did not attenuate the effects of luseogliflozin on fasting glucose. These findings may explain the smaller increase in urinary glucose excretion in these patients relative to patients with normal renal function or normal-to-moderately reduced renal function. Further studies may be needed to examine these findings in large populations of patients with T2DM and reduced renal function. JapicCTI-142548. Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd."
36,26977813,2016,PloS one,Ipragliflozin Improves Hepatic Steatosis in Obese Mice and Liver Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Irrespective of Body Weight Reduction.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a high incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) related to obesity and insulin resistance. Currently, medical interventions for NAFLD have focused on diet control and exercise to reduce body weight, and there is a requirement for effective pharmacological therapies. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral antidiabetic drugs that promote the urinary excretion of glucose by blocking its reabsorption in renal proximal tubules. SGLT2 inhibitors lower blood glucose independent of insulin action and are expected to reduce body weight because of urinary calorie loss. Here we show that an SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin improves hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet-induced and leptin-deficient (ob/ob) obese mice irrespective of body weight reduction. In the obese mice, ipragliflozin-induced hyperphagia occurred to increase energy intake, attenuating body weight reduction with increased epididymal fat mass. There is an inverse correlation between weights of liver and epididymal fat in ipragliflozin-treated obese mice, suggesting that ipragliflozin treatment promotes normotopic fat accumulation in the epididymal fat and prevents ectopic fat accumulation in the liver. Despite increased adiposity, ipragliflozin ameliorates obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance in epididymal fat. Clinically, ipragliflozin improves liver dysfunction in patients with T2DM irrespective of body weight reduction. These findings provide new insight into the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on energy homeostasis and fat accumulation and indicate their potential therapeutic efficacy in T2DM-associated hepatic steatosis.

Newer pharmacologic treatments for T2DM include glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. Both the classes of medication are efficacious, exhibit positive effects on weight, and are associated with minimal risk of hypoglycemia. The purpose of this review is to compare the clinical trial and real-world effectiveness data of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors related to A1c reduction, weight loss, cost-effectiveness, cardiovascular outcomes, and safety in patients with T2DM. This review summarizes comparative evidence for providers who are determining which of the two classes may be the most appropriate for a specific patient. "
38,27612553,2017,Trends in cardiovascular medicine,Impact of empagliflozin in patients with diabetes and heart failure.,"Heart failure (HF) is a common disease with increased risk for mortality and morbidity among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Optimal glycemic control in this patient population is challenging as many available therapies can potentially exacerbate symptoms of HF. Empagliflozin is one in a novel class of agents, the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, that lowers blood glucose by increasing urinary glucose excretion and improves glycemic control and lowers body weight and blood pressure. In the recent EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin was shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular risk where it reduced HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death, with a consistent benefit among patients both with and without baseline HF. Here, we review the empagliflozin data on HF outcomes and discuss potential mechanisms for its benefits in HF with a focus on the potentially significant impact that empagliflozin may have on the care of patients with T2DM and HF in the future."
39,27854055,2017,Advances in therapy,Fixed-Dose Combination of Canagliflozin and Metformin for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes: An Overview.,"Metformin is recommended as a first-line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, many patients do not achieve glycemic goals with metformin monotherapy and require subsequent combination therapy with other antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs). For newly diagnosed patients with high blood glucose, initial combination therapy may be required to achieve glycemic control. The American Association for Clinical Endocrinologists algorithm for the treatment of T2DM recommends metformin plus a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor as the first oral combination in patients who present with HbA1c ≥7.5%. Canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, lowers the renal threshold for glucose and increases urinary glucose excretion leading to a mild osmotic diuresis and a net caloric loss. The effect of canagliflozin is insulin-independent and complementary to other AHAs, including metformin. A fixed-dose combination (FDC) of canagliflozin and metformin is also available with variable dosing, which may be attractive to some patients owing to the potential for reduced pill burden and costs. This article reviews the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in combination with metformin based on data from the canagliflozin phase 3 clinical program. As initial combination therapy in drug-naïve patients or as dual therapy with metformin or triple therapy in combination with metformin and other AHAs, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg improved glycemic control and provided reductions in body weight and systolic blood pressure that were sustained for up to 104 weeks. Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated across studies in combination with metformin. An increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) related to the mechanism of SGLT2 inhibition (i.e., genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, osmotic diuresis-related AEs) was observed with canagliflozin. Canagliflozin was associated with a low incidence of hypoglycemia when not used in conjunction with AHAs associated with hypoglycemia (i.e., insulin or sulfonylurea). Together, these results support the use of a canagliflozin and metformin FDC as a treatment approach for a broad range of patients with T2DM. Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC."

The effects of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, on pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, and double product were assessed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This post hoc analysis was based on pooled data from four 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluating canagliflozin in patients with T2DM (N = 2313) and a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) study evaluating canagliflozin in patients with T2DM and hypertension (N = 169). Changes from baseline in SBP, DBP, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, and double product were assessed using seated BP measurements (pooled studies) or averaged 24-h BP assessments (ABPM study). Safety was assessed based on adverse event reports. In the pooled studies, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg reduced SBP (-4.3 and -5.0 vs -0.3 mmHg) and DBP (-2.5 and -2.4 vs -0.6 mmHg) versus placebo at week 26. Reductions in pulse pressure (-1.8 and -2.6 vs 0.2 mmHg), mean arterial pressure (-3.1 and -3.3 vs -0.5 mmHg), and double product (-381 and -416 vs -30 bpm × mmHg) were also seen with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus placebo. In the ABPM study, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg reduced mean 24-h SBP (-4.5 and -6.2 vs -1.2 mmHg) and DBP (-2.2 and -3.2 vs -0.3 mmHg) versus placebo at week 6. Canagliflozin 300 mg provided reductions in pulse pressure (-3.3 vs -0.8 mmHg) and mean arterial pressure (-4.2 vs -0.6 mmHg) compared with placebo, while canagliflozin 100 mg had more modest effects on these parameters. Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated in both study populations. Canagliflozin improved all three cardiovascular physiologic markers, consistent with the hypothesis that canagliflozin may have beneficial effects on some cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM.

41,28403850,2017,Cardiovascular diabetology,Rationale and design of a multicenter placebo-controlled double-blind randomized trial to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on endothelial function: the EMBLEM trial.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by systemic metabolic abnormalities and the development of micro- and macrovascular complications, resulting in a shortened life expectancy. A recent cardiovascular (CV) safety trial, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, showed that empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, markedly reduced CV death and all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with T2DM and established CV disease (CVD). SGLT2 inhibitors are known to not only decrease plasma glucose levels, but also favorably modulate a wide range of metabolic and hemodynamic disorders related to CV pathways. Although some experimental studies revealed a beneficial effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on atherosclerosis, there is a paucity of clinical data showing that they can slow the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with T2DM. Therefore, the EMBLEM trial was designed to investigate whether empagliflozin treatment can improve endothelial function, which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, in patients with T2DM and established CVD. The EMBLEM trial is an ongoing, prospective, multicenter, placebo-controlled double-blind randomized, investigator-initiated clinical trial in Japan. A total of 110 participants with T2DM (HbA1c range 6.0-10.0%) and with established CVD will be randomized (1:1) to receive either empagliflozin 10 mg once daily or a placebo. The primary endpoint of the trial is change in the reactive hyperemia (RH)-peripheral arterial tonometry-derived RH index at 24 weeks from baseline. For comparison of treatment effects between the treatment groups, the baseline-adjusted means and their 95% confidence intervals will be estimated by analysis of covariance adjusted for the following allocation factors: HbA1c (<7.0 or ≥7.0%), age (<65 or ≥65 years), systolic blood pressure (<140 or ≥140 mmHg), and current smoking status (nonsmoker or smoker). Key secondary endpoints include the change from baseline for other vascular-related markers such as arterial stiffness, sympathetic nervous activity, and parameters of cardiac and renal function. Importantly, serious adverse effects independently on the causal relationship to the trial drugs and protocol will be also evaluated throughout the trial period. EMBLEM is the first trial to assess the effect of empagliflozin on endothelial function in patients with T2DM and established CVD. Additionally, mechanisms associating empagliflozin-mediated actions with endothelial function and other CV markers will be evaluated. Thus, the trial is designed to elucidate potential mechanisms by which empagliflozin protects CV systems and improves CV outcomes.

42,28428225,2017,Diabetes,Empagliflozin and Kinetics of Renal Glucose Transport in Healthy Individuals and Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes.,"Renal glucose reabsorption was measured with the stepped hyperglycemic clamp in 15 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 15 without diabetes after 2 days and after more chronic (14 days) treatment with empagliflozin. Patients with T2DM had significantly greater maximal renal glucose transport (Tm<sub>G</sub>) compared with subjects without diabetes at baseline (459 ± 53 vs. 337 ± 25 mg/min; <i>P</i> < 0.05). Empagliflozin treatment for 48 h reduced the Tm<sub>G</sub> in both individuals with and without diabetes by 44 ± 7 and 53 ± 6%, respectively (both <i>P</i> < 0.001). Tm<sub>G</sub> was further reduced by empagliflozin in both groups on day 14 (by 65 ± 5 and 75 ± 3%, respectively). Empagliflozin reduced the plasma glucose concentration threshold for glucose spillage in the urine similarly in individuals with T2DM and without diabetes to <40 mg/dL, which is well below the normal fasting plasma glucose concentration. In summary, sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibition with empagliflozin reduces both Tm<sub>G</sub> and threshold for glucose spillage in the urine in patients with T2DM and those without diabetes."
43,28508457,2017,International journal of clinical practice,Effects of canagliflozin on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The main contributors to cardiovascular risk in T2DM are chronic hyperglycaemia, reduced insulin sensitivity, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Other cardiovascular risk factors include obesity and visceral adiposity, increased arterial stiffness and renal dysfunction. Results from clinical trials, including a long-term cardiovascular outcome study, have shown that sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can provide multiple cardiometabolic benefits beyond glycaemic control including inducing mild osmotic diuresis, natriuresis and weight loss. This review article describes the effects of canagliflozin on cardiovascular risk factors based on results from its clinical development programme. This review is based on structured searches to identify literature related to the effects of canagliflozin on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with T2DM. Canagliflozin treatment has been shown to provide glycaemic improvements as well as reductions in blood pressure and body weight across a broad range of patients with T2DM, including those with elevated cardiovascular risk. Other observed effects of canagliflozin that may contribute to improved cardiometabolic outcomes include reduction in uric acid levels, decreased albuminuria and increases in serum magnesium. Results of ongoing long-term cardiovascular outcomes studies of canagliflozin are expected to provide additional evidence on the cardiometabolic effects of canagliflozin treatment."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anticancer activity of dapagliflozin as an SGLT2 inhibitor on RCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect SGLT2 expression on different human renal cells. Then, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to investigate the effects of dapagliflozin on cell cycle, apoptosis, and SGLT2 expression of CaKi-1 cells. Finally, a xenograft model and immunohistochemical staining were used to investigate the function of dapagliflozin in nude mice. RESULTS We proved that SGLT2 is highly expressed in RCC cell lines. We found that dapagliflozin exerts a higher cytotoxic effect on human RCC than on normal human renal cells, regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis, and reduces the glucose uptake and SGLT2 expression of CaKi-1 cells. Moreover, dapagliflozin inhibits tumor growth and reduces SGLT2 expression in vivo. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that dapagliflozin has high efficiency and low toxicity and could be a new therapeutic target for RCC."

The patients continued open-label ipragliflozin for a 28-week extension period (total treatment duration: 52 weeks). Ipragliflozin significantly decreased glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels and body weight from baseline to week 24 (last observation carried forward) compared with placebo in all patients with RI. The decreases in HbA1c and FPG levels were statistically significant in patients with mild RI, but not in patients with moderate RI. Ipragliflozin significantly reduced body weight in both RI groups. The improvements in glycaemic control were maintained in the 28-week extension period. Ipragliflozin was associated with no clinically significant safety concerns, and its safety profiles were not influenced by the severity of RI. Ipragliflozin significantly improved glycaemic control and body weight in patients with T2DM with mild RI, but did not improve glycaemic control in patients with moderate RI. Ipragliflozin is a valid treatment option for patients with mild RI but not those with moderate RI."

While luseogliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar for patients across all renal function groups, the increase in plasma concentration was slightly slower and maximum concentration was slightly reduced in the lower eGFR groups compared with the other groups. However, luseogliflozin pharmacodynamics were affected by the severity of renal impairment. Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) increased in all groups relative to baseline levels, but the degree of UGE increase was smaller in the lower eGFR groups. Moreover, plasma glucose AUC changes from baseline tended to be smaller in the lower eGFR groups. No clear trends were observed between eGFR and incidence, type, or severity of adverse events.

In particular, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction that develops from the early stages of T2DM is an important factor in the onset and exacerbation of heart failure. The effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on left ventricular diastolic function has not been elucidated. We have performed the first prospective study on the effects of canagliflozin on left ventricular diastolic function in T2DM. This study was performed to evaluate the effects of additional treatment with canagliflozin for 3 months on left ventricular diastolic function in patients with T2DM. A total of 38 patients with T2DM were consecutively recruited for this study. Left ventricular diastolic function was assessed by echocardiography. The primary study outcome was a change in the septal E/e' as a parameter of left ventricular diastolic function. A total of 37 patients (25 males and 12 females) were included in the analysis. Mean age of participants was 64.2 ± 8.1 years (mean ± SD), mean duration of diabetes was 13.5 ± 8.1 years, and mean HbA1c was 7.9 ± 0.7%. Of the participants, 86.5% had hypertension, 100% had dyslipidemia, and 32.4% had cardiovascular disease. Canagliflozin significantly improved left ventricular diastolic function (septal E/e' ratio 13.7 ± 3.5-12.1 ± 2.8, p = 0.001). Furthermore, among the various parameters that changed through the administration of canagliflozin, only changes in hemoglobin significantly correlated with changes in the septal E/e' ratio (p = 0.002). In multiple regression analysis, changes in hemoglobin were also revealed to be an independent predictive factor for changes in the septal E/e' ratio. This study showed for the first time that canagliflozin could improve left ventricular diastolic function within 3 months in patients with T2DM.

Among people with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the most common drug at initiation was a sulfonylurea, 58% (659/1135). In 2000, sulfonylureas were the predominant drug at the first stage of drug intensification (87%, 534/615) but by 2017 this fell to 30% (355/1183) as the use of newer drug classes increased. In 2017, new prescriptions for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) and sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) accounted for 42% (502/1183) and 22% (256/1183) of intensification drugs, respectively. Uptake of new classes differs by country with DPP4is and SGLT2is prescribed more in Northern Ireland and Wales than England or Scotland. Our findings show markedly changing prescribing patterns for T2DM between 2000 and 2017, largely consistent with clinical guidelines."

This retrospective study involved mainly elderly patients with T2DM who had received tofogliflozin for 12 months. Data on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), haematocrit, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio were retrieved and analysed. Data from 69 patients (77% of whom were ≥65 years) showed that there was a significant reduction in HbA1c over the 12-month treatment period with tofogliflozin. However, the drug had no significant effect on levels of haematocrit, electrolytes, eGFR or BUN/creatinine ratio. This retrospective analysis of data from mainly elderly Japanese patients with T2DM showed that 12-month administration of tofogliflozin exhibited glucose-lowering capabilities with accompanying low risk of electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration."
54,30635924,2019,Clinical cardiology,The effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists on cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Patients with type 2 diabetes have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to the general population-with CVD accounting for two out of every three deaths in patients with diabetes. In 2008, the FDA suggested that CVD risk should be evaluated for any new antidiabetic therapy, leading to a multitude of large CVD outcome trials to assess CVD risk from these medications. Interestingly, several of these outcome trials with new novel antidiabetic therapies have demonstrated a clear and definite CVD advantage at mid-term follow up in high-risk patients with T2DM. In this review, we discuss two relatively new classes of diabetic drugs, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, and their efficacy in improving cardiovascular outcomes."

The parameter response efficacy (PRE) score was developed to predict how short-term drug effects on cardiovascular risk markers translate into long-term changes in clinical outcomes. We applied the PRE score to clinical trials of dapagliflozin to model the effect of the drug on kidney and heart failure (HF) outcomes in patients with T2DM and impaired kidney function. The relationships between multiple risk markers and long-term outcome were determined in a background population of patients with T2DM with a multivariable Cox model. These relationships were then applied to short-term changes in risk markers observed in a pooled database of dapagliflozin trials (n = 7) that recruited patients with albuminuria to predict the drug-induced changes to kidney and HF outcomes. A total of 132 and 350 patients had UACR >200 mg/g and >30 mg/g at baseline, respectively, and were selected for analysis. The PRE score predicted a risk change for kidney events of -40.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) -51.7 to -29.4) and -40.4% (95% CI -48.4 to -31.1) with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo for the UACR >200 mg/g and >30 mg/g subgroups. The predicted change in risk for HF events was -27.3% (95% CI -47.7 to -5.1) and -21.2% (95% CI -35.0 to -7.8), respectively. Simulation analyses showed that even with a smaller albuminuria-lowering effect of dapagliflozin (10% instead of the observed 35% in both groups), the estimated kidney risk reduction was still 26.5 and 26.8%, respectively. The PRE score predicted clinically meaningful reductions in kidney and HF events associated with dapagliflozin therapy in patients with diabetic kidney disease. These results support a large long-term outcome trial in this population to confirm the benefits of the drug on these endpoints."

A PK/PD model for the change from baseline in UGE for 24 hours (ΔUGE<sub>24h</sub> ) with area under the concentration-time curve from time of dosing to 24 h after administration (AUC<sub>24h</sub> ) of ipragliflozin was described by a maximum effect model. A population PK model was also constructed using rich PK sampling data obtained from 2 clinical pharmacology studies and sparse data from 4 late-phase studies by the NONMEM $PRIOR subroutine. Finally, we simulated how the PK/PD of ipragliflozin changes in response to dose regime as well as patients' renal function using the developed model. The estimated individual maximum effect were dependent on fasting plasma glucose and renal function, except in patients who had significant UGE before treatment. The PK of ipragliflozin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients was accurately described by a 2-compartment model with first order absorption. The population mean oral clearance was 9.47 L/h and was increased in patients with higher glomerular filtration rates and body surface area. Simulation suggested that medians (95% prediction intervals) of AUC<sub>24h</sub> and ΔUGE<sub>24h</sub> were 5417 (3229-8775) ng·h/mL and 85 (51-145) g, respectively. The simulation also suggested a 1.17-fold increase in AUC<sub>24h</sub> of ipragliflozin and a 0.76-fold in ΔUGE<sub>24h</sub> in T2DM patients with moderate renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. The developed models described the clinical data well, and the simulation suggested mechanism-based weaker antidiabetic effect in T2DM patients with renal impairment."
57,31099200,2019,"Endocrinology and metabolism (Seoul, Korea)",The Role of Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists and Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors in Reducing Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, is increasing worldwide. Although there have been advances in diabetes treatments that reduce microvascular complications (nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy), many clinical studies have found that conventional oral hypoglycemic agents and glucose control alone failed to reduce cardiovascular disease. Thus, incretin-based therapies including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is) represent a new area of research, and may serve as novel therapeutics for treating hyperglycemia and modifying other cardiovascular risk factors. Recently, it has been confirmed that several drugs in these classes, including canagliflozin, empagliflozin, semaglutide, and liraglutide, are safe and possess cardioprotective effects. We review the most recent cardiovascular outcome trials on GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2Is, and discuss their implications for treating patients with T2DM in terms of protective effects against cardiovascular disease."
58,31269877,2019,Journal of the American Heart Association,Changes in the Prescription of Glucose-Lowering Medications in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus After a Cardiovascular Event: A Call to Action From the DATAFILE Study.,"Background Evidence accumulated that some glucose-lowering medications protect against cardiovascular events ( CVEs ) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and established cardiovascular disease. The present study evaluated if and how glucose-lowering medication prescription pattern changes in T2DM after a CVE. Methods and Results DATAFILE (Diabetes Therapy After a Cardiovascular Event) was a retrospective multicenter study conducted at 12 diabetes mellitus specialist outpatient clinics in Italy. We identified T2DM patients with an incident CVE for whom a follow-up visit was available after the event. We selected control T2DM patients without an incident CVE , who were matched with cases for age, sex, known diabetes mellitus duration, baseline hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>, kidney function, and follow-up time. We extracted clinical variables and compared prescribed therapies at baseline and follow-up. We included 563 patients with and 497 matched patients without an incident CVE . As expected, patients with a subsequent CVE had a higher baseline prevalence of ischemic heart disease. After a median of 9.5 months, in patients with versus those without a CVE , there was a significant increase in the prescription of beta-blockers, loop diuretics, dual antiplatelet therapy, and, among glucose-lowering medications, a significant decrease in metformin. Hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> marginally declined only in the control group, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased only in patients with CVE . Conclusions This study highlights that occurrence of a CVE in T2DM patients did not prime the prescription of glucose-lowering medications provided with cardiovascular protective effects, even though glucose control remained poor. These data emphasize the need to optimize the therapeutic regimen of T2DM patients with established cardiovascular disease, according to updated guidelines."
59,31369642,2019,PloS one,Clinical parameters affecting the therapeutic efficacy of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"We aimed to investigate the clinical factors affecting the therapeutic effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We reviewed the medical records of 374 T2DM patients aged between 20 and 75 years who were prescribed empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg as add-on therapy for more than 90 consecutive days. Changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline levels and the reduction in body weights of the study participants were assessed. We found that younger patients (≤ 50 years), patients with the highest levels of HbA1c (>9%) at baseline, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >90 mL/min/1.73 m2, and patients with a shorter duration of T2DM (< 10 years) were more likely to exhibit a better glycemic response. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that a shorter duration of T2DM, higher baseline levels of HbA1c, and higher eGFR were positively associated with HbA1c reduction. Higher BMI and lower HbA1c levels were predictors of a more significant reduction in body weight among patients taking empagliflozin. The glucose-lowering effect of empagliflozin was more evident in T2DM patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels, better renal function, and shorter duration of T2DM."
60,31653956,2019,Scientific reports,"Effect of Empagliflozin on Cardiac Function, Adiposity, and Diffuse Fibrosis in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.","Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, significantly improves cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic patients; however, the mechanism is unclear. We hypothesized that empagliflozin might have beneficial effects on cardiac function, structure, adiposity, and myocardial diffuse fibrosis. This prospective study enrolled 35 patients (48.6% men, age 63.5 ± 9.7 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from June 1, 2017, to November 31, 2018. The patients received an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin 25 or 12.5 mg/d) for 6 months in addition to stable oral hypoglycaemic treatment. All patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) before and after empagliflozin treatment. Left ventricular (LV) function and structure were quantified using cine CMRI. Cardiac adiposity was defined based on pericardial fat and intracardiac triglyceride contents, whereas myocardial diffuse fibrosis was indicated by extracellular volume (ECV). The statistical significance of parameter changes was assessed using paired t-test and stepwise multiple linear regression. There were no significant differences in LV function and structure changes. Cardiac adiposity and diffuse fibrosis indices were also not different before and after empagliflozin treatment. Concerning clinical parameters, only a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (by 6.4 mmHg) was observed (p = 0.013). Stepwise multiple linear regression revealed that worse baseline MRI parameters were associated with better improvements. Intracardiac triglyceride content decrease was inversely associated with baseline intracardiac triglyceride content (p < 0.001). Pericardial fat changes were negatively correlated with baseline pericardial fat (p < 0.001) and ECV changes (p = 0.028). ECV changes were inversely associated with baseline ECV (p < 0.001), baseline LV ejection fraction (p < 0.001), and LV mass index changes (p = 0.020). This study demonstrated that 6 months of empagliflozin treatment did not significantly improve the LV function, structure, adiposity, and diffuse fibrosis in patients with T2DM. Further, the beneficial effects of empagliflozin treatment might be more evident in patients with worse baseline LV substrate and structure."

62,32372290,2020,Advances in therapy,Pooled Safety and Tolerability Analysis of Empagliflozin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"The aim of this analysis was to characterize the safety and tolerability of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were randomized to empagliflozin (10/25 mg) or placebo in clinical trials. Pooled data from 20 trials were analyzed for patients with T2DM treated with empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 4858), empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 5057), or placebo (n = 4904). The dataset comprised 15 randomized phase I-III trials, an extension trial and dose escalation studies. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed descriptively in participants who took ≥ 1 dose of study drug. AE incidence rates per 100 patient-years were calculated to adjust for differences in drug exposure between trials. Total exposure was 16,480 and 7857 patient-years in the pooled empagliflozin 10/25 mg and placebo groups, respectively. The incidence of any AEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, severe AEs, and serious AEs was similar across groups. The frequency of serious AEs requiring hospitalization was 18.6% for the empagliflozin 10/25 mg group and 21.3% for the placebo group. The empagliflozin 10/25 mg group was not associated with a higher rate of confirmed hypoglycemia versus placebo, except in patients co-administered insulin and/or a sulfonylurea (31.5% vs. 30.2%, respectively). The incidence of events consistent with urinary tract infections (UTI) was also similar for the empagliflozin 10/25 mg group versus placebo (9.27 vs. 9.70/100 patient-years, respectively). History of UTI was identified as a risk factor for UTI during treatment. Events consistent with genital infections occurred more frequently with empagliflozin 10/25 mg than placebo (3.54 vs. 0.95/100 patient-years, respectively). The frequency of AEs consistent with volume depletion was similar across groups, but higher with empagliflozin 10/25 mg than placebo in patients aged 75 to < 85 years and those on loop diuretics at baseline. This comprehensive analysis confirms that both empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg are well tolerated in patients with T2DM, reinforcing the established clinical safety profile of empagliflozin."

PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, CNKI and Wanfang databases were searched up to 31 December 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) applicable in dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin vs monotherapy as added to metformin in the treatment of T2DM were included. The outcomes included changes in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP, DBP and adverse reactions. Fixed or random effects model were used to assess these outcomes. In this study, 8 RCTs involved 7346 patients were included. Compared with dapagliflozin plus metformin(DM) group, patients treated with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin add on to metformin(DSM) could significantly increase the adjusted mean change levels of HbA1c, FPG, SBP and DBP(P < .00001, SMD = -4.88, 95%CI = -6.93∼-2.83; P < .00001, SMD = -6.50, 95%CI = -8.55∼-4.45; P < .00001, SMD = -0.97, 95%CI = -1.15∼-0.78; P < .00001, SMD = -2.00, 95%CI = -2.20∼-1.80), but no major difference in body weight loss showed(P = .12, SMD = 0.92, 95%CI = -0.22∼2.06). Furthermore, DSM therapy displayed better effects than saxagliptin plus metformin(SM) in the adjusted mean change levels of HbA1c, FPG, body weight and SBP(P < .00001, SMD = -7.75, 95%CI = -8.84∼-6.66; P < .00001, SMD = -7.75, 95%CI = -8.84∼-6.66; P = .04, SMD = -3.40, 95%CI = -6.64∼-0.17; P = .04, SMD = -7.75, 95%CI = -8.84∼-6.66), whereas no obvious difference in lowering DBP(P = .18, SMD = -16.35, 95%CI = -40.12∼7.41). Additionally, compared with DM and SM groups, there were no remarkable difference in the incidence of nausea, influenza, headache, diarrhea, urinary tract infection and renal failure for patients taking DSM, but the incidence of genital infection and hypoglycemia were higher in DSM group. Patients taking the DSM therapy had better effects in reducing the level of HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP and DBP than the DM and SM therapy. However, patients treated with DSM therapy are more likely to have hypoglycemia and genital infection. Dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin may be a suitable therapy strategy for patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin, and this will provide a clinical reference for the treatment of T2DM."

The present study evaluated pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of canagliflozin in Japanese patients with T2DM. Canagliflozin, at doses of 25, 100, 200, or 400 mg, was administered as a single dose and, after a washout of 1 day, in repeated doses for 14 consecutive days to 61 subjects in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Plasma concentrations of canagliflozin and urinary glucose excretion (UGE) were measured, and renal threshold for glucose excretion (RTG) was calculated. Safety was evaluated on the basis of adverse event (AE) reports, blood and urine laboratory parameters, and vital signs. Plasma canagliflozin maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values increased in a dose-dependent manner with the time to maximum concentration (t max) of 1.0 h and elimination half-life (t 1/2) of 10.22-13.26 h on Day 1. No significant changes in t max and t 1/2 were observed after multiple-dose administration. The linearity factors, as calculated from the ratios of AUC0-24h on Day 16 to AUC0-∞ on Day 1, were close to 1 in all canagliflozin groups. Canagliflozin increased UGE0-24h (80-110 g/day with canagliflozin ≥100 mg) and decreased RTG from the first day of treatment; these effects were sustained during the entire period of multiple administration. No significant AEs were noted. Urine volume was slightly increased on Day 1, but subsequent changes after repeated doses for 14 days were small. Urinary sodium tended to be higher in the early treatment period, whereas no particular change was observed in serum osmolality and hematocrit. Canagliflozin increased UGE, decreased RTG, and was well tolerated throughout the entire period of multiple administrations in Japanese patients with T2DM. Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation.

66,30096243,2018,Diabetes technology & therapeutics,Effect of Canagliflozin on Urinary Albumin Excretion in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Microalbuminuria: A Pilot Study.,"Albuminuria characterizes the progression of kidney injury. The effect of canagliflozin on the excretion of microalbumin was assessed for investigating its renoprotective potential in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Twenty Japanese patients with T2DM and microalbuminuria were enrolled and administered with 100 mg of canagliflozin once a day for 12 weeks. These subjects were admitted to the clinic at the start and end of the treatment period for 24-h urine collection. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in geometric mean 24-h urinary albumin excretion from baseline to week 12. The urinary albumin level decreased by 42.0% (95% confidence interval: 21.9-57.0; P = 0.0011) after 12 weeks of canagliflozin treatment. A number of blood and urinary parameters also significantly decreased, including hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and creatinine clearance, while hematocrit was elevated. Among the biomarkers associated with kidney injury and inflammation, the urinary level of the oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine was also decreased. There were no meaningful correlations noted between changes in urinary albumin excretion and other parameters/biomarkers. No severe adverse events were reported over the 12-week treatment period. The results of this study indicate that canagliflozin decreases microalbuminuria in Japanese patients with T2DM. Albuminuria could be reduced as a result of changes in various physiological pathways; therefore, it is imperative that future, large-scale, studies attempt to determine the detailed mechanisms involved. Canagliflozin may offer a novel therapeutic option for Japanese patients with T2DM and incipient nephropathy."

CanCARE is a 12-month, prospective, observational analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of CANA in usual clinical practice in Canada. SGLT2i-naïve adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n = 527) on a stable antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) regimen with glycated hemoglobin (A1C) ≥ 7%, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> , were initiated on CANA as part of their usual treatment approach, and were followed for a period of 12 months. The primary effectiveness objective was the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to 6 and 12 months. Significant improvement from baseline in mean HbA1c levels were observed at 6 months (-0.90%; 95% CI, -1.02, -0.78) and at 12 months (-1.04%; 95% CI, -1.15, -0.92), regardless of duration of diabetes or background AHA treatment regimen. Similarly, significant decreases in systolic blood pressure (-4.65 mm Hg); body weight (-3.24 kg), waist circumference (-2.91 cm) and body mass index (-1.15 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ) were observed at 12 months. Additionally, 40.5% of patients achieved the double endpoint (≥0.5% HbA1c reduction and ≥ 3% weight loss), while 24.3% of patients achieved the triple composite endpoint (≥0.5% HbA1c reduction, ≥3% weight loss and ≥ 4 mm Hg systolic blood pressure reduction).

68,31815757,2020,Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,Renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors: an update.,"SGLT2 inhibitors are a new class of antihyperglycemic drugs that protect kidneys and hearts of type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients with preserved kidney function from failing. Here we discuss new insights on renal protection. Also in T2DM patients with CKD, SGLT2 inhibition causes an immediate functional reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and reduces blood pressure and preserves kidney and heart function in the long-term, despite a lesser antihyperglycemic effect. According to modeling studies, the GFR reduction reduces the tubular transport work and metabolic demand, thereby improving renal cortical oxygenation. In humans, the latter is linked to protection from CKD. Urine metabolomics in T2DM patients suggested improved renal mitochondrial function in response to SGLT2 inhibition, and experimental studies indicated improved tubular autophagy. Modeling studies predicted that also in diabetic CKD, SGLT2 inhibition is natriuretic and potentially stimulates erythropoiesis by mimicking systemic hypoxia in the kidney. Meta-analyses indicated that SGLT2 inhibition also reduces risk and severity of acute kidney injury in T2DM patients. Studies in nondiabetic mice implied inhibition of the renal urate transporter URAT1 in the uricosuric effect of SGLT2 inhibition. Renoprotection of SGLT2 inhibition involves blood glucose-dependent and independent effects and extends to CKD."
69,31227915,2019,Current cardiology reports,Effect of SGLT2 Inhibitors on the Sympathetic Nervous System and Blood Pressure.,"Hyperactivity of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a role in the development of arterial hypertension and heart failure, two co-morbidities frequently associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This review aims at analyzing the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) on blood pressure and more especially on SNS activity in patients with T2DM. By enhancing glucosuria, natriuresis, and osmotic diuresis, SGLT2is improve glucose control, promote weight loss, lower arterial blood pressure, and reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events and hospitalization for heart failure. No rise of heart rate is detected despite reductions in blood pressure and plasma volume, which may suggest a dampening of SNS activity. Indeed, increasing experimental and clinical data demonstrated a reduction in SNS activity, including in key target organs such as the heart and the kidneys. Of potential major interest, a better understanding of the mechanisms linking SGLT2 and SNS deserves further investigation."
70,29520964,2018,European journal of heart failure,Type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure: a position statement from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology.,"The coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF), either with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is frequent (30-40% of patients) and associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization, all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and a direct detrimental effect of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in HF patients, and vice versa, which emphasizes the importance of an active search for both disorders in the clinical practice. There are no specific limitations to HF treatment in T2DM. Subanalyses of trials addressing HF treatment in the general population have shown that all HF therapies are similarly effective regardless of T2DM. Concerning T2DM treatment in HF patients, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first-line choice. Sulphonylureas and insulin have been the traditional second- and third-line therapies although their safety in HF is equivocal. Neither glucagon-like preptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk for HF hospitalization. Indeed, a DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, has been associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with (or at risk of) HF. In recent trials, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have both shown a significant reduction in HF hospitalization in patients with established CV disease or at risk of CV disease. Several ongoing trials should provide an insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM."
71,28717115,2017,International heart journal,Coronary Artery Disease and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major risk factor of coronary artery diseases (CAD). Clinical outcomes in CAD with T2DM are poor despite improvement in medications and intervention devices. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is superior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in treating diabetic patients with multivessel coronary artery diseases (MVD). However, selecting a revascularization strategy should depend not only on the lesion complexity but also on the patient's background and comorbidities. In addition, comprehensive risk management with medical and non-pharmacological therapies is important, as is confirmation of whether risk managements are appropriately achieved. Recently, novel anti-diabetic drugs have been demonstrated to have effectiveness in reducing cardiovascular events, which was independent of their glucose-lowering effect. Furthermore, non-pharmacological interventions using exercise and diet during the earlier stages of abnormal glucose metabolism might be beneficial in preventing the development or progression of T2DM and reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events."
72,30708071,2019,Diabetes & metabolism,Beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on fatty liver in type 2 diabetes: A common comorbidity associated with severe complications.,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are exposed to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a comorbidity associated with cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, and which may progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis. Sodium-glucose cotransporter type-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are glucose-lowering agents that improve glucose control while promoting weight loss and lowering serum uric acid levels. These agents may exert cardiovascular and renal protection in T2DM patients with established cardiovascular disease. Recent findings from both randomized controlled trials and open-label studies have also shown that SGLT2 inhibitors are able to reduce fatty liver content, as assessed by different imaging techniques, and improve biological markers of NAFLD, especially serum liver enzymes, in patients with T2DM. In addition, there are emerging data to suggest a mechanism beyond the reduction of hyperglycaemia and body weight, and a potential role for the decrease in low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress associated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. This positive effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on NAFLD complements their already well-known effects on cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases."
73,31522263,2019,Current cardiology reports,Mechanisms and Evidence for Heart Failure Benefits from SGLT2 Inhibitors.,"To review the clinical trial data and underlying mechanistic principles in support of the robust cardiovascular (CV) benefits, in particular, heart failure (HF) outcomes association with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Several large CV outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and with either established atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD) or at high risk for ASCVD reveal that SGLT2 inhibitors cause reductions in CV and HF endpoints. The reduction in ASCVD appears to be confined to those with established ASCVD on the order of ≈ 14%, as does the mortality benefit-all-cause and CV-related. However, hospitalization for HF are reduced by ≈ 33% and occur regardless of baseline patient characteristics. The unprecedented HF outcomes are theorized to occur via several possible mechanisms and include optimization of conventional ASCVD risk factors, improvement in hemodynamics, prevention of cardiac and renal remodeling, inhibition of hormone dysregulation, use of more efficient metabolic substrates, ion channel inhibition, anti-inflammatory effects, and anti-oxidant effects. Recent evidence has unveiled the irrefutable data that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce CV events in patients with T2DM, with a profound effect on reductions in hospitalization for HF. Though several mechanisms conveying this benefit are suggested, most are based in limited data requiring further validation. Nonetheless, the arrival of SGLT2 inhibitors has ushered in a new era of CV risk reductions therapies."
74,30463454,2018,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes mellitus: the latest developments.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disorder associated with high cardiovascular (CV) risk. Some of the therapeutic strategies are contraindicated in patients with concomitant heart disease. However, the newest antidiabetic medications, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, have shown to significantly reduce CV mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations. The mechanism behind these surprising cardiac benefits remains unclear. Areas covered: This article reviews the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety data for the different SGLT2 inhibitors. Specific attention is devoted to the postulated mechanisms of action for their benefit. The therapeutic efficacy and potential use in different indications outside T2DM such as HF, T1DM, and renal disease are also discussed. Expert opinion: SGLT2 inhibitors have an excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors are a safe and efficacious treatment option for T2DM. Given their cardiac benefits (reduction in HF and death) and the low incidence of adverse events, SGLT2 inhibitors are being currently studied as a treatment for HF also in nondiabetic individuals. These agents seem to represent a shift in the treatment of HF patients regardless their glycemic profile."
75,30697905,2019,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular, renal and safety outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","The use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been limited, primarily because glycaemic efficacy is dependent on kidney function. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and CKD, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> . We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library until 7 August 2018 and websites of the US, European and Japanese regulatory authorities until 27 July 2018 for data from randomized controlled trials of SGLT2 inhibitors that included reporting of effects on biomarkers, cardiovascular, renal or safety outcomes in individuals with T2DM and CKD. Random effects models and inverse variance weighting were used to calculate relative risks with 95% confidence intervals. Data were obtained from 27 studies with up to 7363 participants involved. In patients with T2DM and CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors lowered glycated haemoglobin (-0.29%; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.19) as well as blood pressure, body weight and albuminuria. SGLT2 inhibition reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94) and heart failure (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.48-0.78), without a clear effect on all-cause mortality (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73-1.01). These agents also attenuated the annual decline in eGFR slope (placebo-subtracted difference of 1.35 mL/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> /y; 95% CI, 0.78-1.93) and reduced the risk of the composite renal outcome (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53-0.95). There was no evidence of additional risks with SGLT2 inhibition in CKD beyond those already known for the class, although heterogeneity was observed across individual agents for some safety outcomes. Currently available data suggest that, despite only modest reductions in glycated haemoglobin, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with T2DM and CKD, without clear evidence of additional safety concerns."
76,30929540,2019,Postgraduate medicine,SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: overview of current evidence.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a frequent complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as adverse economic and social effects. Slowing the development and progression of CKD remains an unmet clinical need in patients with T2DM. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are widely used for the management of T2DM and have effects beyond glucose lowering that include cardiovascular benefits and potential renoprotective effects. Although the glucose-lowering efficacy of these agents is dependent on renal function, the cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibition appear to be maintained to estimated glomerular filtration levels as low as 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Clinical evidence has indicated that these agents can reduce the risk of development or worsening of albuminuria, a marker of renal damage, through a range of mechanisms. These include blood pressure lowering, reduction of intraglomerular pressure and hyperfiltration, modification of inflammatory processes, reduction of ischemia-related renal injury, and increases in glucagon levels. The blood pressure-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is maintained in people with CKD and could further contribute to reduced renal burden, as well as potentially offering synergistic effects with antihypertensive therapies in these patients. Several cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) have included renal endpoints, adding to the growing evidence of the potential renoprotective effects of these agents in patients with T2DM. Several ongoing dedicated renal outcomes trials will provide further guidance on the potential clinical role of SGLT2 inhibitors in slowing the development and progression of renal impairment in individuals with T2DM."
77,30449220,2019,Postgraduate medicine,Efficacy and renal outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.,"To review glucose-lowering efficacy and changes in renal function associated with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A literature search of MEDLINE and Cochrane databases was performed from 2000 to August 2018 using search terms: SGLT2 inhibitors, sodium glucose co-transporter 2, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, ertugliflozin, and chronic kidney disease. References of identified articles were also reviewed. English-language studies investigating glucose-lowering endpoints and/or changes in renal function with one of four U.S. approved SGLT2 inhibitors were included. A total of 10 studies met inclusion criteria and are included in this review. In patients with T2DM and CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors are modestly effective in lowering hemoglobin A1C and fasting plasma glucose compared to placebo. Small reductions in eGFR are seen shortly after initiating therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors, but return to baseline levels after discontinuation. SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a substantial reduction in albuminuria and reduced risk of progression to albuminuria. In patients with T2DM and CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors have a decreased glucose-lowering effect compared to patients without CKD. Renal benefits among patients with CKD are similar to those without CKD and include a significant reduction in albuminuria and reduced incidence of worsening albuminuria. Given that CKD and T2DM are both associated with increased cardiovascular risk, we believe these agents should considered as preferred add-on agents in most patients with uncontrolled T2DM and eGFR >30 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Ongoing studies will provide additional information as to whether these agents should be added to the current standard of care for CKD patients, with and without T2DM."
78,32855502,2020,Nature reviews. Endocrinology,Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is becoming increasingly complex. Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are the newest antidiabetic agents for T2DM. By targeting the kidney, they have a unique mechanism of action, which results in enhanced glucosuria, osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, thereby improving glucose control with a limited risk of hypoglycaemia and exerting additional positive effects such as weight loss and the lowering of blood pressure. Several outcome studies with canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin reported a statistically significant reduction in major cardiovascular events, hospitalization for heart failure and progression to advanced renal disease in patients with T2DM who have established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, several cardiovascular risk factors, albuminuric mild to moderate chronic kidney disease or heart failure. Current guidelines proposed a new paradigm in the management of T2DM, with a preferential place for SGLT2is, after metformin, in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and progressive kidney disease. Ongoing trials might extend the therapeutic potential of SGLT2is in patients with, but also without, T2DM. This Review provides an update of the current knowledge on SGLT2is, moving from their use as glucose-lowering medications to their new positioning as cardiovascular and renal protective agents."

The VERTIS cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial (NCT01986881) has a primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of ertugliflozin versus placebo on major adverse CV events: time to the first event of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary objectives are to demonstrate superiority of ertugliflozin versus placebo on time to: 1) the composite outcome of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure (HF); 2) CV death; and 3) the composite outcome of renal death, dialysis/transplant, or doubling of serum creatinine from baseline. Patients ≥40 years old with T2DM (HbA1c 7.0-10.5%) and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) of the coronary, cerebral, and/or peripheral arterial systems, were randomized 1:1:1 to once daily double-blind placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg added to existing therapy. 8246 patients were randomized and 8238 received at least 1 dose of investigational product. Mean age was 64.4 years, 11.0% were ≥75 years old, and mean diabetes duration was 12.9 years with screening HbA1c of 8.3%. At entry, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease were present in 76.3%, 23.1%, and 18.8% of patients, respectively. HF was present in 23.1%, and Stage 3 kidney disease in 21.6% of patients. The results from the VERTIS-CV trial will define the CV and renal safety and efficacy of ertugliflozin in patients with T2DM and ASCVD."
80,28099783,2017,Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,Ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis in response to SGLT2 inhibitors: Basic mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives.,"Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter SGLT2 are a new class of antihyperglycemic drugs that have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These drugs inhibit glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidney thereby enhancing glucosuria and lowering blood glucose levels. Additional consequences and benefits include a reduction in body weight, uric acid levels, and blood pressure. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibition can have protective effects on the kidney and cardiovascular system in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk. However, a potential side effect that has been reported with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and particularly during off-label use in patients with type 1 diabetes is diabetic ketoacidosis. The US Food and Drug Administration recently warned that SGLT2 inhibitors may result in euglycemic ketoacidosis. Here, we review the basic metabolism of ketone bodies, the triggers of diabetic ketoacidosis, and potential mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors may facilitate the development of ketosis or ketoacidosis. This provides the rationale for measures to lower the risk. We discuss the role of the kidney and potential links to renal gluconeogenesis and uric acid handling. Moreover, we outline potential beneficial effects of modestly elevated ketone body levels on organ function that may have therapeutic relevance for the observed beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the kidney and cardiovascular system."
81,29898853,2018,American heart journal,The design and rationale for the Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE)-TIMI 58 Trial.,"Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor that reduces blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by promoting glycosuria via inhibiting urinary glucose reabsorption. In addition to improving blood glucose control, treatment with dapagliflozin results in glucose-induced osmotic diuresis, weight loss, and blood pressure lowering. Previous trials of SGLT-2 inhibitors showed reductions in cardiovascular (CV) events, including CV death and hospitalization for heart failure, and ischemic events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). DECLARE-TIMI 58 (NCT01730534) is a phase 3b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the CV safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin that has completed randomization of 17,160 patients with T2DM and a history of either established ASCVD (n=6,971) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (n=10,189). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to dapagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo. The primary safety outcome is the time to the first event of the composite of CV death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke (major adverse cardiovascular events; MACEs). The co-primary efficacy outcomes are the composite of CV death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke and the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure. This event-driven trial will continue until at least 1,390 subjects have a MACE outcome, thereby providing >99% power to test for the primary outcome of safety of dapagliflozin measured by rejecting the hypothesis that the upper bound of the CI >1.3 for the primary outcome of MACE, as well as 85% power to detect a 15% relative risk reduction in MACE and an estimated 87% power to detect a 20% reduction in the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure at a 1-sided α level of .0231. The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial is testing the hypotheses that dapagliflozin is safe (does not increase) and may reduce the occurrence of major CV events. DECLARE-TIMI 58 is the largest study to address this question with an SGLT-2 inhibitor in patients with T2DM and with established CV disease and without CV disease but with multiple risk factors."

It is now known that each disease represents a risk factor for the other. Moreover, when they are combined, the prognosis is significantly worse. Until recently, these pathologies have been managed independently. However, their treatment paradigm is rapidly changing, with recent cardiovascular outcome trials showing that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) are effective in the management of both diseases. This article explores the interactions between T2DM and HF and the concept of diabetic cardiomyopathy and summarizes recent data regarding the effects of SGLT-2i on HF hospitalization and the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms involved."
83,30266577,2018,Diabetes & metabolism,Effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on systemic and tissue low-grade inflammation: The potential contribution to diabetes complications and cardiovascular disease.,"Chronic low-grade inflammation is a recognized key feature associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications. In prospective randomized trials, sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated benefits related to several cardiovascular and renal risk factors, including HbA<sub>1c</sub>, blood pressure, body weight, renal hyperfiltration, and improvement of cardiorenal outcomes. SGLT2 inhibitors may improve adipose tissue function and induce decreases in serum leptin, TNF-α and IL-6 while increasing adiponectin. While data on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and other inflammatory markers are relatively scarce in humans, in animals, a number of reports have shown reductions in cytokine and chemokine concentrations in parallel with protective effects against progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Experimental findings also suggest that part of the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibition may be related to anti-inflammatory actions at the kidney level. Underlying mechanisms to explain this anti-inflammatory effect are multiple, but may involve weight loss, and reduction in adipose tissue inflammation, slight increase in ketone bodies and diminution of uric acid levels or attenuation of oxidative stress. However, further studies in diabetes patients with specific assessment of inflammatory markers are still necessary to determine the specific contribution of the anti-inflammatory action of SGLT2 inhibitors to the reduction of cardiovascular and renal complications and mortality observed with this class of antidiabetic drugs."
84,29667921,2018,Postgraduate medicine,Glycemic control of type 2 diabetes mellitus across stages of renal impairment: information for primary care providers.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a frequent complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and elevates individuals' risk for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in T2DM. Achieving and maintaining tight glycemic control is key to preventing development or progression of CKD; however, improving glycemic control may be limited by effects of renal impairment on the efficacy and safety of T2DM treatments, necessitating dosing adjustments and careful evaluation of contraindications. Understanding the treatment considerations specific to each class of T2DM medication is important in individualizing therapy and improving glycemic, renal, and cardiovascular outcomes. Traditional glucose-lowering treatments include insulin, metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones. Each of these agents exhibits altered pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment except for the thiazolidinediones, which are metabolized by the liver and do not accumulate appreciably in patients with renal impairment. Newer glucose-lowering treatments include GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors. Of these, only the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin can be used across all stages of renal impairment without dosing restrictions or concerns regarding dose escalation, and all SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated when eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. Several of the newer treatments have also been investigated for effects on renal and cardiovascular outcomes, demonstrating potential benefits of the GLP-1 agonists liraglutide and semaglutide, as well as the SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin and empagliflozin, in reducing risk for some adverse renal and cardiovascular events. In addition, some DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to reduce albuminuria, an indicator of glomerular dysfunction. Consideration of this information is useful in informing optimal management strategies for patients with T2DM and concomitant CKD. More clinical data from future and ongoing clinical trials, including data regarding potential renal and cardiovascular benefits, will be important in clarifying the safety and efficacy profiles of each of these agents in patients with CKD."
85,30462565,2019,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,Preventing and treating kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a huge burden in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This review therefore has the aim of assessing the add-on value of new glucose-lowering agents compared or combined with inhibitors of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) on renal outcomes in T2DM patients. This article first summarizes the results reported with RAAS inhibitors, mainstay of nephroprotection in T2DM with albuminuria. Second, it describes the positive results with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and, even more impressive, sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). Third, besides the potential of combined therapies, it briefly considers some new approaches currently in development. RAAS inhibitors exert renoprotective effects beyond their blood pressure lowering effects while SGLT2is, and possibly GLP-1RAs, exert nephroprotection independently of their glucose-lowering activity. These effects were demonstrated not only on surrogate endpoints such as albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, but also on hard endpoints, including progression to end-stage renal disease requiring replacement therapy. The underlying mechanisms are different and potentially complementary on glomerular hemodynamics, arguing for combined therapies. Nevertheless, there is still room for new emerging drugs to tackle CKD in T2DM."
86,29704192,2018,Heart failure reviews,SGLT2 inhibition and heart failure-current concepts.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major risk factor for several cardiovascular (CV) conditions, including heart failure (HF). However, until recently, no therapy to treat patients with diabetes could also reduce CV risks related to HF. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial with empagliflozin was the first to demonstrate significant cardioprotective benefits in this population. Its impressive 35% reduction in hospitalizations for HF drew the attention of the scientific community to the possibility that pharmacologic sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition could be part of the armamentarium for treating patients with HF, with and without diabetes. The recently published CANVAS Program (with canagliflozin) and real-life data from the CVD-Real Study (using dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin) further strengthened this hypothesis, suggesting that the observed benefit is not restricted to a particular drug, but is rather a class effect. This review explores the effects of pharmacologic SGLT2 inhibitors' use in cardiac function and discusses the potential role of this class of medication as a treatment for HF."
87,25488697,2015,Drugs,"Pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Inhibitors of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) are proposed as a novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several compounds are already available in many countries (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin and ipragliflozin) and some others are in a late phase of development. The available SGLT2 inhibitors share similar pharmacokinetic characteristics, with a rapid oral absorption, a long elimination half-life allowing once-daily administration, an extensive hepatic metabolism mainly via glucuronidation to inactive metabolites, the absence of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions and a low renal elimination as parent drug. SGLT2 co-transporters are responsible for reabsorption of most (90 %) of the glucose filtered by the kidneys. The pharmacological inhibition of SGLT2 co-transporters reduces hyperglycaemia by decreasing renal glucose threshold and thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion. The amount of glucose excreted in the urine depends on both the level of hyperglycaemia and the glomerular filtration rate. Results of numerous placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials of 12-104 weeks duration have shown significant reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), resulting in a significant increase in the proportion of patients reaching HbA1c targets, and a significant lowering of fasting plasma glucose when SGLT2 inhibitors were administered as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering therapies including insulin in patients with T2DM. In head-to-head trials of up to 2 years, SGLT2 inhibitors exerted similar glucose-lowering activity to metformin, sulphonylureas or sitagliptin. The durability of the glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be better; however, this remains to be more extensively investigated. The risk of hypoglycaemia was much lower with SGLT2 inhibitors than with sulphonylureas and was similarly low as that reported with metformin, pioglitazone or sitagliptin. Increased renal glucose elimination also assists weight loss and could help to reduce blood pressure. Both effects were very consistent across the trials and they represent some advantages for SGLT2 inhibitors when compared with other oral glucose-lowering agents. The pharmacodynamic response to SGLT2 inhibitors declines with increasing severity of renal impairment, and prescribing information for each SGLT2 inhibitor should be consulted regarding dosage adjustments or restrictions in moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Caution is also recommended in the elderly population because of a higher risk of renal impairment, orthostatic hypotension and dehydration, even if the absence of hypoglycaemia represents an obvious advantage in this population. The overall effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of cardiovascular disease is unknown and will be evaluated in several ongoing prospective placebo-controlled trials with cardiovascular outcomes. The impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function and their potential to influence the course of diabetic nephropathy also deserve more attention. SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events are female genital mycotic infections, while urinary tract infections are less commonly observed and generally benign. In conclusion, with their unique mechanism of action that is independent of insulin secretion and action, SGLT2 inhibitors are a useful addition to the therapeutic options available for the management of T2DM at any stage in the natural history of the disease. Although SGLT2 inhibitors have already been extensively investigated, further studies should even better delineate the best place of these new glucose-lowering agents in the already rich armamentarium for the management of T2DM.

88,28836359,2017,European journal of heart failure,The potential role and rationale for treatment of heart failure with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors.,"Heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are both growing public health concerns contributing to major medical and economic burdens to society. T2DM increases the risk of HF, frequently occurs concomitantly with HF, and worsens the prognosis of HF. Several anti-hyperglycaemic medications have been associated with a concern for worse HF outcomes. More recently, the results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial showed that the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin was associated with a pronounced and precocious 38% reduction in cardiovascular mortality in subjects with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease [Correction added on 8 September 2017, after first online publication: ""32%"" in the previous sentence was corrected to ""38%""]. These benefits were more related to a reduction in incident HF events rather than to ischaemic vascular endpoints. Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain these benefits, which also raise the possibility of using these drugs as therapies not only in the prevention of HF, but also for the treatment of patients with established HF regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. Several large trials are currently exploring this postulate."

SGLT2 inhibitors are being actively studied in the treatment of patients with HF, including in those without diabetes mellitus. Despite the accumulating data supporting this class of therapies in HF prevention, cardiologists infrequently prescribe SGLT2 inhibitors, potentially due to lack of familiarity with their use.

Until recently, anti-diabetic drugs have not been shown to reduce hospitalization due to heart failure (hHF). While thiazolidinedione class and saxagliptin has shown a significantly increased risk, sodium-glucose linked co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2Is) have demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of hHF. Areas covered: We systematically searched the database of PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and International conference presentation up to 25 December 2018 and retrieved all the studies that were conducted for ≥24 weeks and explicitly reported hHF outcome. Subsequently, we conducted the meta-analysis to study the effect of SGLT-2Is on hHF outcome in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and both. Expert opinion: The meta-analysis of RCTs (N = 34,322), observational studies (N = 15,36,339), and both (N = 15,70,661) demonstrated a significant decrease in hHF (OR 0.70, 0.64, 0.66, respectively, all p = 0.000) with SGLT-2Is compared to placebo or other anti-diabetes drugs in T2DM. A significant benefit in hHF (OR 0.68, p = 0.000) is also observed in patients with established HF (N = 3891) in sub-group meta-analysis of RCTs. Ongoing dedicated HF trials will further enlighten the merits of SGLT-2Is in patients with established heart failure (preserved or reduced) with or without T2DM."
91,31617144,2019,Journal of echocardiography,Heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: assessment with echocardiography and effects of antihyperglycemic treatments.,"Heart failure is one of the major cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Although active management for heart failure is needed in patients with T2DM, traditional treatment and some new class of antihyperglycemic drugs, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, could not reduce the risk of heart failure. Recent major trials demonstrated sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve prognosis of T2DM patients through prevention of heart failure. Both heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and that with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is observed in T2DM patients, and HFpEF is often overlooked and misdiagnosed in these population. Left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial dilatation, diastolic dysfunction, and subclinical systolic dysfunction indicated as reduced global longitudinal strain are major abnormalities on echocardiography in patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy. These structural and functional changes are also prevalent in the general patients with T2DM, and those with these abnormalities have higher incidence of heart failure than those without them. Glycemic control might improve some of these abnormalities on echocardiography, but it is still unclear whether their improvement could be associated with risk reduction for heart failure. At now, there are only limited data on the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors on echocardiography in T2DM patients. Large-scale trials are needed to clarify how antihyperglycemic drugs affect echocardiographic parameters."
92,29415819,2018,Journal of cardiology,A new class of drugs for heart failure: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce sympathetic overactivity.,"Even in the presence of excess glucose, the proximal renal tubules continue to resorb more glucose. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are drugs that control this ""greed"" (H. Ito, Keio University, Japan). Negative feedback mechanisms maintain homeostasis for various physiological functions. However, there is no negative feedback mechanism for resorption of glucose by the proximal renal tubules. When food was scarce during human evolution, not limiting nutrient reabsorption was advantageous for survival, but the opposite is true in the era of satiation. SGLT2 inhibitors were designed to apply the brakes to uncontrolled glucose resorption by the kidneys in patients with diabetes. It has become clear that SGLT2 inhibitors not only improve the blood glucose level, but also show cardiovascular and renal protective effects irrespective of the reduction of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The mechanisms underlying cardiovascular and renal protection by SGLT2 inhibitors in T2DM are complex, multifactorial, and not completely understood. A common, and perhaps underappreciated, feature of T2DM is chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This elevation of sympathetic activity contributes to the development of hypertension. It is also associated with a poor prognosis and with increased cardiovascular and renal morbidity/mortality independently of the effect on blood pressure. This review discusses novel insights into cardiovascular protection by SGLT2 inhibitors, focusing on the interaction between SGLT2 and the sympathetic nervous system."

The effects of empagliflozin in lowering the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in T2DM patients with high cardiovascular risk during the recent Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial may be explained principally in terms of changes to cardiovascular physiology; namely, by the potential ability of empagliflozin to reduce cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen consumption by lowering blood pressure, improving aortic compliance, and improving ventricular arterial coupling. These concepts and hypotheses are discussed in this report."
94,32198123,2020,Diabetes research and clinical practice,Invited review. Series: Implications of the recent CVOTs in type 2 diabetes: Which patients for GLP-1RA or SGLT-2 inhibitor?,"Large cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have lent support to a cardiovascular protection with the use of SGLT2-inhibitors (SGLT2is) and GLP1-Receptor Agonists (GLP1-RAs) in subjects with type 2 diabetes. These two classes of novel glucose lowering agents have been shown to have a similar effect on the risk reduction of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE: nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality). Nonetheless, they may not be simply interchangeable. Rather, careful evaluation of all the results of CVOTs leads identification of different effects that may allow profiling of the ideal individuals with T2DM who may benefit most from the use of one or the other class of agents. These differences include effect on heart failure, stroke and diabetic kidney disease that have prompt recent guidelines and recommendation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes to suggest the preferential use of SGLT2is in those with evidence of heart failure and impaired kidney function, while both SGLT2i and GLP1-RAs with proven effect could be use in those with prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This review discusses all these elements of differentiation along with others that in the future may help establishing the best cardiorenal benefit for individuals with T2DM."
95,30223693,2018,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,Ertugliflozin as a monotherapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.,"Sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are novel, potent oral anti-diabetic agents in a β-cell function-independent manner, inhibiting SGLT2-mediated renal glucose reabsorption and thus increasing urinary glucose excretion. Ertugliflozin (Steglatro<sup>TM</sup>) is a new oral SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents. Areas covered: This review summarizes the collected data concerning the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability profiles of ertugliflozin given as a monotherapy for the management of T2DM. Expert opinion: Good glycemic control is crucial to the management of T2DM, and accordingly, anti-diabetic agents with various anti-hyperglycemic mechanisms are developed one after another. Based on the available clinical trials of ertugliflozin as a monotherapy for T2DM, it could be found that ertugliflozin effectively improves the glycemic control, body weight and blood pressure of patients with a low risk of hypoglycemia. It is also found that ertugliflozin moderately reduces their blood pressure, which is beneficial for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. These attributes show the good potential of ertugliflozin as an adjunct treatment to diet and exercise for improving glycemic control in patients with T2DM."
96,26362302,2016,Biochemical pharmacology,SGLT2 inhibitors.,"Diabetes mellitus is a serious health issue and an economic burden, rising in epidemic proportions over the last few decades worldwide. Although several treatment options are available, only half of the global diabetic population achieves the recommended or individualized glycemic targets. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of antidiabetic agents with a novel insulin-independent action. SGLT2 is a transporter found in the proximal renal tubules, responsible for the reabsorption of most of the glucose filtered by the kidney. Inhibition of SGLT2 lowers the blood glucose level by promoting the urinary excretion of excess glucose. Due to their insulin-independent action, SGLT2 inhibitors can be used with any degree of beta-cell dysfunction or insulin resistance, related to a very low risk of hypoglycemia. In addition to improving glycemic control, SGLT2 inhibitors have been associated with a reduction in weight and blood pressure when used as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors is usually well tolerated; however, they have been associated with an increased incidence of urinary tract and genital infections, although these infections are usually mild and easy to treat. SGLT2 inhibitors are a promising new option in the armamentarium of drugs for patients with T2DM. "
97,32475628,2020,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",Risk stratification tools for heart failure in the diabetes clinic.,"The advent of Sodium Glucose Transporter 2-inhibitors (SGLT2-i) in recent years gave endocrinologists the opportunity to actively treat and prevent heart failure (HF) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). While the relationship between T2DM and HF has been extensively reviewed, previous works focused mostly on epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment of HF in T2DM. The aim of our work was to aid health care professionals in identifying individuals at high risk for this dreadful complication. Recent guidelines recommend to use drugs with proven cardiovascular benefits (Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) and SGLT2-i) in patients with previous cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to prefer SGLT2-i in patients with known HF. In everyday clinical practice, the choice between these two drug classes in patients without known HF or atherosclerotic CVD is mostly arbitrary and based on the side effect profile. Recently, risk stratification tools to estimate HF incidence have been developed in order to guide treatment with a view to bring precision medicine into diabetes care. With this purpose, we provide a review of the tools able to predict HF incidence for patients in primary CVD prevention as well as risk of future hospitalizations for patients with known HF."
98,31235111,2019,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,Are SGLT2 inhibitors joining the mainstream therapy for diabetes type 2?,"Conventional therapies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complications are only partially effective. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches leading to additional risk reduction are required. While many anti-diabetic medications have been prescribed world-wide for controlling T2DM over the past half-century, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are relatively new. In addition to their plasma glucose lowering effect, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce considerably cardiovascular mortality rate in patients with T2DM. Since, a risk and benefit analysis of co-administration of SGLT2 inhibitors and other anti-diabetic agents in patients who suffer from hypertension, heart failure or renal deficiency is currently lacking, the main objective of this article is to review the recent literature and provide the health care professionals with evidence-based opinions on the subject. SGLT2 inhibitors have relatively safe profiles and can efficiently decrease HbA1c as well as fasting and postprandial glucose levels. Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors administrations are not associated with significant hypoglycemic episodes or weight gain. Thus, combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and other less harmful anti-diabetic medicines could be considered if there is no any contraindication."

Areas covered: In this paper, the authors critically discuss the background, trial design, results and implications of a recent CVOT [NCT01730534; DECLARE-TIMI 58 study], which demonstrated that dapagliflozin was non-inferior to placebo in terms of major adverse cardiovascular events, and superior for the occurrence of hospitalization for heart failure (HF) and composite renal endpoints, thus confirming the cardiovascular benefit of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. No statistically-significant effects were found for amputations, fractures, and stroke (debated safety issues having emerged in previous CVOTs). Expert opinion: DECLARE-TIMI 58 is the longest (4.2 years of follow up), largest (>17,000 participants) and most inclusive (only 41% of individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) CVOT raising the debate towards SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in primary prevention and the potential use of these drugs also in patients with HF without T2DM and other subpopulations."

It is estimated that 30% of people aged > 65 years fulfil the diagnostic criteria for DM, with 90% having type 2 DM (T2DM). Generally, specific guidelines for the treatment of T2DM in older people address in a very limited manner the use of more recent therapies, such as sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), which have important benefits for older people, such as a low risk of hypoglycemia, reduction of cardiovascular and renal risk, and an insulin-independent mechanism, allowing its use in disease of any duration. The SGLT2i class is well-tolerated, though some caution is also suggested, including adjustment of concomitant therapies, such as insulin and antihypertensives, especially loop diuretics. This review discusses the pathophysiological characteristics of the older patient with T2DM and evaluates the main benefits of and cautions for the use of SGLT2i in this population."

This study assessed the effects of licogliflozin, a dual inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) 1/2, on body weight, metabolic parameters and incretin hormones in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or obesity. Patients with obesity (BMI, 35-50 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ) were enrolled into a 12-week study (N = 88; licogliflozin 150 mg q.d.). Patients with T2DM were enrolled into a second, two-part study, comprising a single-dose cross-over study (N = 12; 2.5 - 300 mg) and a 14-day dosing study (N = 30; 15 mg q.d). Primary endpoints included effects on body weight, effects on glucose, safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included urinary glucose excretion (UGE<sub>24</sub> ) and pharmacokinetics, while exploratory endpoints assessed the effects on incretin hormones (total GLP-1, PYY<sub>3-36</sub> , and GIP), insulin and glucagon. Treatment with licogliflozin 150 mg q.d. for 12 weeks in patients with obesity significantly reduced body weight by 5.7% vs placebo (P < 0.001) and improved metabolic parameters such as significantly reduced postprandial glucose excursion (21%; P < 0.001), reduced insulin levels (80%; P < 0.001) and increased glucagon (59%; P < 0.001). In patients with T2DM, a single dose of licogliflozin 300 mg in the morning prior to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) remarkably reduced glucose excursion by 93% (P < 0.001; incremental AUC<sub>0-4h</sub> ) and suppressed insulin by 90% (P < 0.01; incremental AUC<sub>0-4h</sub> ). Treatment with licogliflozin 15 mg q.d. for 14 days reduced 24-hour average glucose levels by 26% (41 mg/dL; P < 0.001) and increased UGE<sub>24</sub> to 100 g (P < 0.001) in patients with T2DM. In addition, this treatment regimen significantly increased total GLP-1 by 54% (P < 0.001) and PYY<sub>3-36</sub> by 67% (P < 0.05) post OGTT vs placebo, while significantly reducing GIP levels by 53% (P < 0.001). Treatment with licogliflozin was generally safe and well tolerated. Diarrhea (increased numbers of loose stool) was the most common adverse event in all studies (90% with licogliflozin vs 25% with placebo in the 12-week study), while a lower incidence of flatulence, abdominal pain and abdominal distension (25%-43% with licogliflozin vs 9%-11% with placebo in the 12-week study) were among the other gastrointestinal events reported. Licogliflozin treatment (1-84 days) leads to significant weight loss and favourable changes in a variety of metabolic parameters and incretin hormones. Dual inhibition of SGLT1/2 with licogliflozin in the gut and kidneys is an attractive strategy for treating obesity and diabetes."
103,32275926,2020,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,Control of 24-hour blood pressure with SGLT2 inhibitors to prevent cardiovascular disease.,"The presence of hypertension (HTN) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) further worsens cardiovascular disease (CVD) prognosis. In addition, masked HTN and abnormal circadian blood pressure (BP) variability are common among patients with DM. Clinical trial data show that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) improve CVD prognosis and prevent progression of renal dysfunction in high-risk patients with type 2 DM (T2DM). Consistent reductions in 24-hour, daytime and nocturnal BP have been documented during treatment with SGLT2i in patients with DM and HTN, and these reductions are of a magnitude that is likely to be clinically significant. SGLT2i agents also appear to have beneficial effects on morning, evening and nocturnal home BP. Greater reductions in BP during treatment with SGLT2i have been reported in patient subgroups with higher body mass index, and in those with higher baseline BP. Other documented beneficial effects of SGLT2i include reductions in arterial stiffness and the potential to decrease the apnea-hypopnea index in patients with DM and obstructive sleep apnea. Recent guidelines highlight the important role of SGLT2i as part of the pharmacological management of patients with DM and HTN, and recommend consideration of SGLT2i early in the clinical course to reduce all-cause and CVD mortality in patients with T2DM and CVD. Overall, available data support a role for SGLT2i as effective BP-lowering agents in patients with T2DM and poorly controlled HTN, irrespective of baseline glucose control status. Sustained improvements in 24-hour BP and the 24-hour BP profile are likely to contribute to the CVD benefits of SGLT2i treatment."

Reduced insulin sensitivity and secretory capacity, weight gain, sarcopenia, and elevated adiposity are all common metabolic and body changes in the aging population that favor an increased risk of hypoglycemia, frailty syndrome, falls, and cognitive dysfunction. First line antidiabetic therapy is frequently not safe in older individuals because of its high risk of hypoglycemia and prevalent co-morbid diseases, such as chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) is a new class of antidiabetic therapy that inhibits glucose and sodium reabsorption on renal proximal convoluted tubule. Its effect is well demonstrated in various clinical scenarios in the younger population. This review and metanalysis describe particularities of the SGLT2i on the elderly, with mechanistic insights of the potential benefit and remaining challenges about the use of these drugs in this important age group. Further, we will present a meta-analysis of the main effects of SGLT2i reported in post-hoc studies in which the median age of the subgroups analyzed was over 60 years. Despite the absence of specific clinical trials for this population, our findings suggest that SGLT2i therapy on older individuals is effective to lower glucose and maintain its effect on systolic blood pressure and body weight."
105,31142441,2019,Kidney international,Analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME<sup>®</sup> trial indicates empagliflozin may assist in preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes irrespective of medications that alter intrarenal hemodynamics.,"In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular (CV) disease, empagliflozin (EMPA) decreased progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), likely via a reduction in intraglomerular pressure. Due to prevalent comorbidities, such as hypertension and albuminuria, patients often receive other agents that alter intrarenal hemodynamics, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used by some individuals. In this exploratory, non-prespecified analysis, we investigated whether the kidney benefits of EMPA are altered in individuals already using the medications in these categories. In the BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME<sup>®</sup>) trial, 7020 patients were essentially equally randomized to EMPA 10 mg, 25 mg or placebo added to their standard care. Differences in risk of incident or worsening nephropathy for pooled EMPA vs placebo across subgroups by baseline background medications (to which patients were not randomized) were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Risk reductions in incident or worsening nephropathy with EMPA were consistent across medication subgroups, with no heterogeneity of treatment effect. As a representative example, the risk for acute renal failure was overall slightly increased in patients using ACEi/ARBs in all groups (placebo, EMPA 10 mg or EMPA 25 mg) but incidence rates were numerically lower in those assigned to EMPA. Similar patterns were observed for other medications included in this analysis. Thus, EMPA may assist to prevent CKD progression in patients with T2DM with CV disease, irrespective of common background medications that alter intrarenal hemodynamics, and without increasing acute renal adverse events."

Indeed, albuminuria is reduced and eGFR is preserved in the long term by SGLT2is. A significant reduction in cardiovascular events and hard renal outcomes was reported even in patients with eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The overall safety profile of SGLT2is is not altered in patients with mild to moderate DKD, with a reduced (rather than increased) risk of acute renal injury. This positive benefit/risk balance led recent guidelines to recommend SGLT2is in patients with T2DM and mild to moderate DKD, especially if albuminuria."

PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM up to May 20, 2017. A total of 62 studies, comprising 34 941 patients, were included. Any of the SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, tofogliflozin, luseogliflozin or ipragliflozin) significantly decreased SUA levels compared with control (total weighted mean difference [WMD] -37.73 μmol/L, 95% CI [-40.51, -34.95]). Treatment with empagliflozin resulted in a superior reduction in SUA (WMD -45.83 μmol/L, 95% CI [-53.03, -38.63]). The effect persisted during long-term treatment. Dapagliflozin decreased SUA in a dose-dependent manner (from 5 to 50 mg, P = .014). In subgroup analyses, greater reductions could be observed during the course of early diabetes and the SUA-lowering effect was abolished in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> ). The effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on SUA reduction suggests that this class of drugs might be beneficial for diabetic patients with hyperuricaemia."

To evaluate beneficial effects of the SGLT2 inhibitors on metabolic, cardiovascular, and renal outcomes. A Pub-Med search (1966 to July 2017) was performed of published English articles using keywords sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin. A review of literature citations provided further references. The search identified 17 clinical trials and 2 meta-analyses with outcomes of weight loss and blood pressure reduction with dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, or empagliflozin. Three randomized trials focused on either empagliflozin or canagliflozin and reduction of cardiovascular disease and progression of renal disease. SGLT2 inhibitors have a beneficial profile in the treatment of T2DM. They have evidence of reducing weight between 2.9 kilograms when used as monotherapy to 4.7 kilograms when used in combination with metformin, and reducing systolic blood pressure between 3 to 5 mmHg and reducing diastolic blood pressure approximately 2 mmHg. To date, reduction of cardiovascular events was seen specifically with empagliflozin in patients with T2DM and a history of cardiovascular disease. In the same population, empagliflozin was associated with slowing the progression of kidney disease. Moreover, patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease treated with canagliflozin have decreased risk of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke. Data regarding these outcomes with dapagliflozin are underway. SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrate some positive metabolic effects. In addition, empagliflozin specifically has demonstrated reduction in cardiovascular events and delay in the progression of kidney disease in patients with T2DM and a history of cardiovascular disease. Further data is needed to assess if this is a class effect."
109,30477733,2019,Diabetes & metabolism,Effects of glucose-lowering agents on surrogate endpoints and hard clinical renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) represents an enormous burden in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Preclinical studies using most glucose-lowering agents have suggested renal-protective effects, but the proposed mechanisms of renoprotection have yet to be defined, and the promising results from experimental studies remain to be translated into human clinical findings to improve the prognosis of patients at risk of DKD. Also, it is important to distinguish effects on surrogate endpoints, such as decreases in albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and hard clinical endpoints, such as progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death from renal causes. Data regarding insulin therapy are surprisingly scarce, and it is nearly impossible to separate the effects of better glucose control from those of insulin per se, whereas favourable preclinical data with metformin, thiazolidinediones and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors are plentiful, and positive effects have been observed in clinical studies, at least for surrogate endpoints. The most favourable renal results have been reported with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter type-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). Significant reductions in both albuminuria and eGFR decline have been reported with these classes of glucose-lowering medications compared with placebo and other glucose-lowering agents. Moreover, in large prospective cardiovascular outcome trials using composite renal outcomes as secondary endpoints, both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is added to standard care reduced renal outcomes combining persistent macro-albuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, progression to ESRD and kidney-related death; however, to date, only SGLT2is have been clearly shown to reduce such hard clinical outcomes. Yet, as the renoprotective effects of SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs appear to be independent of glucose-lowering activity, the underlying mechanisms are still a matter of debate. For this reason, further studies with renal outcomes as primary endpoints are now awaited in T2DM patients at high risk of DKD, including trials evaluating the potential add-on benefits of combined GLP-1RA-SGLT2i therapies."
110,30148719,2018,Current opinion in cardiology,SGLT2 inhibitors: practical considerations and recommendations for cardiologists.,"To address common concerns regarding sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor use for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in cardiovascular practice. SGLT2 inhibitors provide glycemic control and improve cardiovascular and renal endpoints in T2DM. Cardiovascular outcome trials have demonstrated sustained cardiovascular, heart failure and renal benefits independent of glycemic control, which persist down to an eGFR of 30 ml/min/1.73 m. SGLT2 inhibitors can be safely administered alongside common diuretics, and routine monitoring of renal function is advised at initiation of therapy, particularly for patients on loop diuretics. Mild initial reductions in eGFR are expected, usually stabilizing over time. The most common adverse effect noted with SGLT2 inhibitors is genital mycotic infections, primarily in women. Less common, but concerning effects associated with canagliflozin include increased risk of fractures and lower limb amputations, particularly in patients with previous amputation history. Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors are well tolerated and effective adjuncts to diabetic treatment, for which the benefits seem to outweigh the risks. The care of patients with T2DM requires an interdisciplinary team approach, within which the role of cardiologists is expanding. SGLT2 inhibitors are an encouraging treatment option for achieving glycemic control, whilst also improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes."

112,28619659,2017,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,Effects of Canagliflozin on Cardiovascular Biomarkers in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes.,"Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors may reduce cardiovascular and heart failure risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The goal of this study was to examine the effects of canagliflozin on cardiovascular biomarkers in older patients with T2DM. In 666 T2DM patients randomized to receive canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo, the study assessed the median percent change in serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI), soluble (s)ST2, and galectin-3 from baseline to 26, 52, and 104 weeks. Both serum NT-proBNP and serum hsTnI levels increased in placebo recipients, but they remained largely unchanged in those randomized to canagliflozin. Hodges-Lehmann estimates of the difference in median percent change between pooled canagliflozin and placebo were -15.0%, -16.1%, and -26.8% for NT-proBNP, and -8.3%, -11.9%, and -10.0% for hsTnI at weeks 26, 52, and 104, respectively (all p < 0.05). Serum sST2 was unchanged with canagliflozin and placebo over 104 weeks. Serum galectin-3 modestly increased from baseline with canagliflozin versus placebo, with significant differences observed at 26 and 52 weeks but not at 104 weeks. These results remained unchanged when only patients with complete samples were assessed. Compared with placebo, treatment with canagliflozin delayed the rise in serum NT-proBNP and hsTnI for over 2 years in older T2DM patients. These cardiac biomarker data provide support for the beneficial cardiovascular effect of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in T2DM.

113,30265814,2018,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,Empagliflozin improves cardiorespiratory fitness in type 2 diabetes: translational implications.,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to prevent heart failure and reduce cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether or not SGLT2 inhibitors improve indices of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), an independent predictor of mortality in patients with CVD, remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of empagliflozin on indices of CRF in patients with T2DM. Twenty patients with T2DM received either empagliflozin 10 mg or usual care. Baseline and 3- to 6-month post-treatment measurements of CRF were evaluated using cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a cycle ergometer. Treatment with empagliflozin led to an increased peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>), reduction in VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope, and improvement in heart rate recovery. Our results suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors may improve markers of CRF in patients with T2DM. This may help provide important clues into the mechanism of benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical trials and provide a translational framework for the ongoing large studies of SGLT2 inhibitors in the treatment of heart failure."

We aimed to explore whether SGLT2 inhibitor added to the usual care for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) will benefit NASH histology. In this investigator-initiated, single-arm, open-label, pilot study, nine biopsy-proven NASH patients with T2DM were given empagliflozin 25 mg daily for 24 weeks. Liver biopsy was repeated at the end of treatment. The histological outcomes were compared with the placebo group of a previous 48-week clinical trial. There was a significant reduction in body mass index (median change, Δ = -0.7 kg per m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.011), waist circumference (Δ = -3 cm, p = 0.033), systolic blood pressure (Δ = -9 mmHg, p = 0.024), diastolic blood pressure (Δ = -6 mmHg, p = 0.033), fasting blood glucose (Δ = -1.7 mmol/L, p = 0.008), total cholesterol (Δ = -0.5 mmol/L, p = 0.011), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (Δ = -19 U/L, p = 0.013), volumetric liver fat fraction (Δ = -7.8%, p = 0.017), steatosis (Δ = -1, p = 0.014), ballooning (Δ = -1, p = 0.034), and fibrosis (Δ = 0, p = 0.046). All histological components either remained unchanged or improved, except in one patient who had worsening ballooning. Empagliflozin resulted in significantly greater improvements in steatosis (67% vs. 26%, p = 0.025), ballooning (78% vs. 34%, p = 0.024), and fibrosis (44% vs. 6%, p = 0.008) compared with historical placebo. This pilot study provides primary histological evidence that empagliflozin may be useful for the treatment of NASH. This preliminary finding should prompt larger clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of empagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of NASH in T2DM patients.

115,30957945,2019,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","Navigating the ""MACE"" in Cardiovascular Outcomes Trials and decoding the relevance of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease benefits versus Heart Failure benefits.","The publication of results from recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) has transformed the landscape of diabetes treatment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated CV benefits in large, well-conducted, randomized studies. Today, empagliflozin, canagliflozin and liraglutide are US Food and Drug Administration-approved not only for glucose-lowering, but also to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events/CV mortality in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and established CV disease (CVD)/high CVD risk. Although the CVOTs were primarily powered for CV safety (non-inferiority), they also demonstrated CV efficacy (superiority). This initially surprised many in the diabetes community, but the replication of the CV benefits with different compounds in the same class alleviated concerns about the CV benefits being chance findings. However, many questions remain. While the heterogeneity in the CV benefits in the various CVOTs can be attributed to the variability in CV risk in the different studies, the reason(s) for the differences in the CV benefits between the GLP-1RA class and the SGLT2 inhibitor class appear to be more complex. An analysis of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the CVOTs shows that the CV benefits of GLP-1RAs are predominantly specific to atherosclerotic CV events (non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI], non-fatal stroke and CV death). By contrast, the SGLT2 inhibitors do not have any significant effects on atherosclerotic CV events (non-fatal MI/stroke). Their benefits are predominantly on hospitalization for heart failure (HF), suggesting effects primarily on myocardial function (""the pump""), and not on the ""pipes"" (coronary arteries). In the present review, we discuss the rationale for the conduct of CVOTs, highlight the inability of the classic three-point MACE to capture the entire spectrum of atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic CVD morbidity, especially HF in T2DM, and discuss the results of the CVOTs with a focus on the clinical significance of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) versus HF, which develops in a sizeable proportion of people with diabetes and without prior ASCVD."
116,33121838,2018,Current clinical pharmacology,SGLT-2 Inhibitors in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature.,"Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGTL-2) inhibitors are a new class of antidiabetics, which have been approved for the treatment of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Besides their beneficial metabolic effects, they exert favourable results in cardiovascular events and risk factors along with renoprotection. However, SGLT-2 inhibitors have not been yet approved as an adjunct therapy to insulin in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). This review aims at presenting both clinical and experimental data that reinforce the role of SGLT-2 inhibitors as adjunctive treatment in patients with T1DM along with the main restrictions of their use, namely Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). We conducted a comprehensive research of the relevant literature regarding the off-label use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in clinical practice, presenting the major benefits and the potential risks. SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with improved glycemic control, reduction in body weight, and decrease in insulin dosage, along with their beneficial cardiovascular and renal effects. However, we cannot overlook the association with increased incidence of DKA events, in the presence of well known predisposing factors. Further investigation is required, in order to establish them as adjunctive treatment in those patients. This novel class of antidiabetics seems to be a very attractive treatment option in patients with T1DM, due to their multiple beneficial effects, but the increased risk of DKA should be taken into account."

We investigated the effects of empagliflozin in patients of Asian race.Methods and Results:Patients were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo. Of 7,020 patients treated, 1,517 (21.6%) were of Asian race. The reduction in 3-point MACE in Asian patients was consistent with the overall population: 3-point MACE occurred in 79/1,006 patients (7.9%) in the pooled empagliflozin group vs. 58/511 patients (11.4%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 0.68 [95% confidence interval: 0.48-0.95], P-value for treatment by race interaction (Asian, White, Black/African-American): 0.0872). The effects of empagliflozin on the components of MACE, all-cause mortality, and heart failure outcomes in Asian patients were consistent with the overall population (P-values for interaction by race >0.05). The adverse event profile of empagliflozin in Asian patients was similar to the overall trial population.

118,28025462,2018,JACC. Heart failure,Comparison of New Glucose-Lowering Drugs on Risk of Heart Failure in Type 2 Diabetes: A Network Meta-Analysis.,"The authors conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials in the post-Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance era to formally compare the effects of 3 new classes of glucose-lowering drugs on hospitalization for heart failure (HF) in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The 2008 FDA Guidance for Industry launched an era of cardiovascular outcome trials for new glucose-lowering drugs in T2DM, including glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, and sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors. We searched Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov between December 1, 2008, and November 24, 2017, for randomized placebo-controlled trials, and performed network meta-analyses by Bayesian approach using Markov-chain Monte Carlo simulation method to compare the effects of glucose-lowering drugs on risk of HF hospitalization and estimate the probability that each treatment is the most effective. Nine studies were identified, yielding data on 87,162 participants. In the network meta-analysis, SGLT-2 inhibitors yielded the greatest risk reduction for HF hospitalization compared with placebo (relative risk [RR]: 0.56; 95% CrI [credibility interval]: 0.43 to 0.72). Moreover, SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with significant risk reduction in pairwise comparisons with both GLP-1 agonists (RR: 0.59; 95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.79) and DPP-4 inhibitors (RR: 0.50; 95% CrI: 0.36 to 0.70). Ranking of the classes revealed 99.6% probability of SGLT-2 inhibitors being the optimal treatment for reducing the risk of this outcome, followed by GLP-1 agonists (0.27%) and DPP-4 inhibitors (0.1%). Current evidence suggests that SGLT-2 inhibitors are more effective than either GLP-1 agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors for reducing the risk of hospitalization for HF in type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Here, the role in treatment with this drug class is considered in the context of T2DM treatment paradigms. The clinical trials for the SGLT2 inhibitors are examined with a focus on canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin. Evidence from clinical trials in patients with T2DM supports the use of SGLT2 inhibitors either as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering treatments as adjuncts to diet and exercise, and we have gained significant clinical experience in a relatively short time. The drugs appear to be useful in a variety of T2DM populations, contingent primarily on renal function. Most obviously, SGLT2 inhibitors appear to be well suited for patients with potential for hypoglycemia or weight gain. In clinical trials, patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors have experienced moderate weight loss and a low risk of hypoglycemic events except when used in combination with an insulin secretagogue. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce blood pressure, so they may be beneficial in patients with T2DM complicated by hypertension. SGLT2 inhibitors were incorporated into the 2015 American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) position statement on the management of hyperglycemia and received an even more prominent position in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) comprehensive diabetes management guidelines and algorithm."
120,26132997,2019,Phytotherapy research : PTR,Natural products with SGLT2 inhibitory activity: Possibilities of application for the treatment of diabetes.,"Diabetes mellitus currently affects as many as 400 million people worldwide, creating a heavy economic burden and stretching health care resources. A dysfunction of glucose homeostasis underlies the disease. Despite advances in the treatment of diabetes, many patients still suffer from complications and side effects; hence, development of more effective treatments for diabetes is still desirable. SGLT2 is the principle cotransporter involved in glucose reabsorption in the kidney. SGLT2 inhibition reduces glucose reabsorption by the kidney and ameliorates plasma glucose concentration. The interest in natural products that can be used for the inhibition of SGLT2 is growing. The flavonoid phlorizin, which can be isolated from the bark of apple trees, has been used as lead structure due to its inhibitory activity of SGLT1 and SGLT2. Some phlorizin-derived synthetic compounds, including canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ipragliflozin, and ertugliflozin, are approved by the food and drug administration to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), whereas others are under clinical trials investigation. In addition, other natural product-derived compounds have been investigated for their ability to improve blood glucose control. The present review summarizes the natural products with SGLT2 inhibitory activity, and the synthetic compounds obtained from them, and discusses their application for the treatment of diabetes."

Because T2DM is often associated with renal or hepatic impairment, understanding the effects of these comorbid conditions on the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin, and further assessing its safety, in these special populations is essential. Two open-label studies evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (renal study only), and safety of canagliflozin in participants with hepatic or renal impairment. Participants in the hepatic study (8 in each group) were categorized based on their Child-Pugh score (normal hepatic function, mild impairment [Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6], and moderate impairment [Child-Pugh score of 7-9]) and received a single oral dose of canagliflozin 300 mg. Participants in the renal study (8 in each group) were categorized based on their creatinine clearance (CLCR) (normal renal function [CLCR ≥80 mL/min]; mild [CLCR 50 to <80 mL/min], moderate [CLCR 30 to <50 mL/min], or severe [CLCR <30 mL/min] renal impairment; and end-stage renal disease [ESRD]) and received a single oral dose of canagliflozin 200 mg; the exception was those with ESRD, who received 1 dose postdialysis and 1 dose predialysis (10 days later). Canagliflozin's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (urinary glucose excretion [UGE] and renal threshold for glucose excretion [RTG]) were assessed at predetermined time points. Mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite (AUC)0-∞ values differed by <11% between the group with normal hepatic function and those with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. In the renal study, the mean Cmax values were 13%, 29%, and 29% higher and the mean AUC0-∞ values were 17%, 63%, and 50% higher in participants with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively; values were similar in the ESRD group relative to the group with normal function, however. The amount of UGE declined as renal function decreased, whereas RTG was not suppressed to the same extent in the moderate to severe renal impairment groups (mean RTG, 93-97 mg/dL) compared with the mild impairment and normal function groups (mean RTG, 68-77 mg/dL). Canagliflozin's pharmacokinetics were not affected by mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Systemic exposure to canagliflozin increased in the renal impairment groups relative to participants with normal renal function. Pharmacodynamic response to canagliflozin, measured by using UGE and RTG, declined with increasing severity of renal impairment. A single oral dose of canagliflozin was well tolerated by participants in both studies. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01186588 and NCT01759576."

These findings have prompted growing optimism among clinicians regarding the potential for these agents to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in people with T2DM. GLP-1RAs and SGLT2i are now advocated as second-line agents in European and US guidelines for management of both hyperglycaemia and for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with T2DM. Given the high prevalence of T2DM in patients with cardiovascular disease, cardiologists will increasingly encounter these agents in routine clinical practice. In this review, we summarise evidence from cardiovascular outcome trials of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2i, give practical advice on prescribing and detail safety considerations associated with their use. We also highlight areas where further work is needed, giving details on active clinical trials. The review aims to familiarise cardiologists with these emerging treatments, which will be increasingly encountered in clinical practice, given the expanding representation of T2DM in patients with cardiovascular disease. Whether these drugs will be initiated by cardiologists remains to be determined."
123,31551292,2016,Postgraduate medicine,The kidney and type 2 diabetes mellitus: therapeutic implications of SGLT2 inhibitors.,"Understanding the role of the kidneys in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has taken on an increased importance in recent years with the arrival of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors - antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs) that specifically target the kidneys. This review includes an update on the physiology of the kidneys, their role in the pathophysiology of T2DM, and the mechanisms implicated in the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease, such as glomerular hyperfiltration and inflammation. It also discusses renal issues that could influence the choice of AHA for patients with T2DM, including special populations such as patients with concomitant chronic kidney disease. The most recent data published on the clinical efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin and their effects on renal function are presented, showing how the renally mediated mechanisms of action of these agents translate into clinical benefits, including the potential for renoprotection. The observed positive effects of these agents on measures such as glucose control, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, blood pressure, and body weight in patients both with and without impaired renal function suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors represent an important extension to the diabetes treatment armamentarium.

Two studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tofogliflozin. The studies were: 1) single dose study in T2DM patients with normal renal function and mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, and 2) multiple dose study for 24 weeks in T2DM patients with normal renal function and moderate renal impairment. Renal function did not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of tofogliflozin. Urinary glucose excretion up to 24 h after administration of tofogliflozin (UGE24h) decreased with decreasing glomerular filtration rate. Lowering UGE24h resulted in waning glycemic control but not body weight reduction. Single and multiple administrations of tofogliflozin were generally well tolerated in T2DM patients with various renal functions. As far as investigated here, these studies indicate no dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment."

Knowledge about this complex interplay has dramatically changed recently, due to development of new glucose-lowering drugs, and to specific FDA and EMA Guidance mandating to perform cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), aimed at establishing cardiovascular safety, for new anti-diabetic treatments before they enter the market. Such CVOTs have demonstrated that the effects of the new antidiabetic drugs on the mutual interactions between T2DM and HF may develop across different phases:Results of such trials can be summarized as: (a) all different classes of novel glucose-lowering drugs have good cardiovascular safety profile; (b) with respect to HF, DPP4 inhibitors might tend to increase risk; (c) sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGTLi), significantly reduce it; (d) glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1) tend to be neutral. These CVOTs data have led to guideline recommendations indicating appropriate therapy to T2DM patients with HF not at glycemic control target with metformin therapy."
126,31479706,2015,Current medical research and opinion,Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in triple oral therapy regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"There is no clear consensus regarding treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that is inadequately controlled using dual combination therapy. Recommended agents for triple combination therapy should have complementary mechanisms of action with minimal risk of added side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. We discuss considerations in selecting triple oral therapy regimens in patients with T2DM, and review clinical trial data regarding triple oral therapy using dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. A search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify clinical trials of triple oral therapy incorporating a DPP-4 inhibitor (November 2013 to January 2015), using the following search terms: 'type 2 diabetes' AND 'alogliptin OR linagliptin OR saxagliptin OR sitagliptin OR vildagliptin' AND 'metformin'. Trials had to include adult patients with T2DM who received triple oral therapy with a DPP-4 inhibitor for ≥18 weeks. The bibliographies of retrieved articles were also searched to identify any other relevant trials. A total of 17 clinical trials evaluating metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor combined with a sulfonylurea (SU), thiazolidinedione (TZD), or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor were identified and included in this review. Consistently, the addition of a DPP-4 inhibitor to metformin and SU, TZD, or SGLT2 inhibitor therapy improved glycemic measures, and these combinations were generally well tolerated. An increased incidence of hypoglycemia was reported for combinations that included an SU. Triple oral therapy that includes a DPP-4 inhibitor is a valid option for patients with T2DM not adequately controlled with dual combination therapy, and offers an alternative to insulin therapy. Triple oral therapy with a DPP-4 inhibitor, metformin, and a TZD or SGLT2 inhibitor should be considered when avoidance of hypoglycemia is a primary goal."
127,26361231,2019,Primary care diabetes,Network meta-analysis of nine large cardiovascular outcome trials of new antidiabetic drugs.,"The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to indirectly compare the cardiovascular (CV) safety of new antidiabetic medications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DATA SYNTHESIS: A search of the Embase and MEDLINE databases was conducted systematically to identify cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) of new antidiabetic medications (DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors) in patients with T2DM. The primary outcomes were the composite endpoint of CV death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke (MACE), death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and death from any cause. Hospitalization for HF and unstable angina were evaluated as secondary endpoints. A total of 9 trials, including 87,162 patients, met the eligibility criteria and were retained for the analysis. The NMA results showed no significant differences among the DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, alogliptin, and saxagliptin) in any of the CV endpoints. Similarly, no significant changes were seen in the NMA among the GLP-1 receptor agonists nor the SGLT-2 inhibitors. The pairwise meta-analysis showed that DPP-4 inhibitors have a CV safety profiled comparable to placebo. GLP-1 agonists on the other hand, showed significant reduction in MACE (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.87-0.97), death from CV causes (RR=0.88; 95% CI 0.80-0.97), and death from any cause (RR=0.89; 95% CI 0.82-0.96). SGLT-2 inhibitors showed significant reduction in hospitalization for heart failure events (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.6-0.86) compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis has shown that new antidiabetic medications do not impose any additional CV risk. The indirect comparison among the medications of each class resulted in no significant changes regarding CV endpoints and death from any cause."

A literature search conducted using the Cochrane library resulted in five citations - randomized controlled trials (RCTs), identified for analysis. Positive cardio-renal outcomes from the five RCTs were analyzed in accordance with a pre-defined strategy which included the hierarchical flow chart, presence of a persuasive p-value (p < 0.001), and number needed to treat (NNT) estimation calculated from the absolute risk reduction (ARR) reported. Only four instances fulfilled these stringent criteria - reduction of cardiovascular (CV) death with empagliflozin in T2DM patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (eASCVD) (p < 0.001; NNT 45), reduction in cardiorenal outcomes with canagliflozin in a pooled T2DM population with macroalbuminuria (p < 0.00001; NNT 22), as well as reduction in the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure (hHF) (p < 0.001; NNT 30) and also reduction in hHF or CV death with dapagliflozin in T2DM with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (p < 0.001; NNT 21).

Data were calculated to represent the standardized mean difference (SMD) for each study, and the SMDs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random effects model. Fifty-one studies were included that evaluated eGFR levels, and 17 studies were included that evaluated UACR levels. A meta-analysis showed that SGLT2 inhibitors had no significant effect on eGFR levels (SMD - 0.02, 95% CI - 0.06, 0.03, p = 0.45), and eGFR reduction was observed in the subsets of the duration of the trial 12 < duration ≤ 26 weeks (SMD - 0.08, 95% CI - 0.13, - 0.02, p = 0.005) and mean baseline eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 square meters (SMD - 0.22, 95% CI - 0.37, - 0.07, p = 0.004). We found that SGLT2 inhibitors reduced UACR levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (SMD - 0.11, 95% CI - 0.17, - 0.05, p = 0.0001). Compared with monotherapy, the combination with other hypoglycemic agents can reduce albuminuria levels (SMD - 0.13, 95% CI - 0.19, - 0.06, p < 0.0001). The effect of SGLT2 inhibitor on eGFR in patients with T2DM was not statistically significant, but it was effective in reducing albuminuria levels."
130,30830656,2018,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,Renal and Cardiac Implications of Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors: The State of the Science.,"To review the role of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), including the effects on renal and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. A literature search of MEDLINE databases (1964 through May 2018) was conducted utilizing key words sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and diabetes; additional limits for drug names were added. Available English-language data from reviews, abstracts, presentations, and clinical trials of use of SGLT2 therapy specifically detailing outcomes on CV and renal disease in humans were reviewed. This review will explore the role of the SGLT2 inhibitors on CV and renal outcomes in patients with T2DM. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: A paradigm shift regarding the regulation of medications for the treatment of T2DM has resulted in the need for CV outcomes data as part of the drug approval process. Reduction of major CV events and progression of nephropathy in patients with T2DM represent major outcomes of clinical significance. Few medications have been able to establish a reduction in these end points; data for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors are favorable in this regard. The SGLT2 inhibitors represents a class of medications that reduce glucose levels via a novel and complementary mechanism. Emerging evidence suggests a plausible explanation for the observed reduction in adverse renal and CV outcomes in recent clinical trials. Questions remain whether these agents reduce renal disease risk greater than achievement of the same glycemic goals as other antidiabetics and whether CV and renal benefits are reproducible in high-risk patients with chronic kidney disease."
131,29911393,2017,Reviews on recent clinical trials,SGLT2 Inhibitors in Diabetes Mellitus Treatment.,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic illness with high prevalence in Mexico, Latin- America, and the world and is associated to high morbidity, disability, and mortality rate, especially in developing countries. T2DM physiopathology is very complex; insulin resistance in the muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, a reduction in the production of incretins (mainly GLP-1) in the intestine, increased glucagon synthesis, an insufficient response of insulin generation, and increased glucose reabsorption in the kidney lead all together to an hyperglycemic state, which has been closely associated with the development of micro and macrovascular complications. Sodium Glucose Linked Transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are the most recent therapeutic class available for treating T2DM. SGLT2i central effect is a glycosuric action, and they can reverse the deleterious effect of tubular reabsorption of glucose in the diabetic patient resulting in greater hyperglycemia. Because their mechanism of action is completely different to current drugs, they can be considered as monotherapy or in combination with any other oral or parenteral medication, including different types of insulin or its analogues. This therapeutic synergy accomplishes a greater percentage of patients achieving glycemic control goals."
132,27765008,2017,The American journal of cardiology,EMPA-REG OUTCOME: The Endocrinologist's Point of View.,"For many years, it was widely accepted that control of plasma lipids and blood pressure could lower macrovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), whereas the benefits of lowering plasma glucose were largely limited to improvements in microvascular complications. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study demonstrated for the first time that a glucose-lowering agent, the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin, could reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and overall mortality when given in addition to standard care in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk. These results were entirely unexpected and have led to much speculation regarding the potential mechanisms underlying cardiovascular benefits. In this review, the results of EMPA-REG OUTCOME are summarized and put into perspective for the endocrinologist who is treating patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease."
133,28606344,2018,The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,Clinical Spectrum and Mechanism of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus on SGLT-2 Inhibitors.,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) (such as canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) are widely used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic, cardiovascular and renal outcomes. However, based on post-marketing data, a warning label was added regarding possible occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI). To describe the clinical presentation of T2DM patients treated with SGLT2i who were evaluated for AKI at our institution and to discuss the potential pathophysiologic mechanisms. A retrospective study of a computerized database was conducted of patients with T2DM who were hospitalized or evaluated for AKI while receiving SGLT2i, including descriptions of clinical and laboratory characteristics, at our institution. We identified seven patients in whom AKI occurred 7-365 days after initiation of SGLT2i. In all cases, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers had also been prescribed. In five patients, another concomitant nephrotoxic agent (injection of contrast-product, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cox-2 inhibitors) or occurrence of an acute medical event potentially associated with AKI (diarrhea, sepsis) was identified. In two patients, only the initiation of SGLT2i was evident. The mechanisms by which AKI occurs under SGLT2i are discussed with regard to the associated potential triggers: altered trans-glomerular filtration or, alternatively, kidney medullary hypoxia. SGLT2i are usually safe and provide multiple benefits for patients with T2DM. However, during particular medical circumstances, and in association with usual co-medications, particularly if baseline glomerular filtration rate is decreased, patients treated with SGLT2i may be at risk of AKI, thus warranting caution when prescribed."
134,30084579,2018,Diabetes technology & therapeutics,Combined SGLT1 and SGLT2 Inhibitors and Their Role in Diabetes Care.,"The sodium-glucose cotransporter type 1 (SGLT1) is the primary transporter for absorption of glucose and galactose in the gastrointestinal tract. Inhibition blunts and delays postprandial glucose (PPG) excursion. Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) is expressed in the kidney, where it reabsorbs 90% of filtered glucose. Thus, a dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition (compared with selective SGLT2 inhibition) could result in lower PPG and robust A1c reduction even in patients with reduced kidney function. Sotagliflozin is an oral potent dual inhibitor of the insulin-independent SGLT1 and SGLT2. Preliminary data released from phase 2 and 3 clinical studies in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) showed improved glycemic control, and met efficacy endpoints beyond A1c with a safety profile consistent with the SGLT class: significant reduction in body weight, systolic blood pressure, and efficacy maintained in lower estimated glomerular filtration rate levels with no increased hypoglycemia. Increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with uncharacteristically mild-to-moderate glucose elevations (euglycemic DKA) is associated with the use of all the approved SGLT2 inhibitors. Factors that trigger DKA include insulin reductions, low caloric and fluid intake, intercurrent illness, and alcohol use. However, DKA is detectable and manageable with proper patient education. With sotagliflozin, DKA rates were not higher than the expected background rate in T1DM, but numerically higher than placebo. Sotagliflozin is the first oral SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor developed for the treatment of adult patients with T1DM, in adjunct with insulin, and has the potential to address unmet needs for patients with T1DM and possibly T2DM, with a favorable benefit/risk profile."
135,29916741,2016,Nature reviews. Endocrinology,Pharmacology and therapeutic implications of current drugs for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global epidemic that poses a major challenge to health-care systems. Improving metabolic control to approach normal glycaemia (where practical) greatly benefits long-term prognoses and justifies early, effective, sustained and safety-conscious intervention. Improvements in the understanding of the complex pathogenesis of T2DM have underpinned the development of glucose-lowering therapies with complementary mechanisms of action, which have expanded treatment options and facilitated individualized management strategies. Over the past decade, several new classes of glucose-lowering agents have been licensed, including glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. These agents can be used individually or in combination with well-established treatments such as biguanides, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Although novel agents have potential advantages including low risk of hypoglycaemia and help with weight control, long-term safety has yet to be established. In this Review, we assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety profiles, including cardiovascular safety, of currently available therapies for management of hyperglycaemia in patients with T2DM within the context of disease pathogenesis and natural history. In addition, we briefly describe treatment algorithms for patients with T2DM and lessons from present therapies to inform the development of future therapies. "
136,27339889,2017,International journal of cardiology,Mechanisms linking empagliflozin to cardiovascular and renal protection.,"In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the main cause of morbidity and mortality is cardiovascular (CV) disease. Diabetic kidney disease, which develops in approximately 40% of patients with T2DM, further increases the risk of CV-related morbidity and mortality. The sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin, which provides effective glycaemic control as either monotherapy or as an add-on to other glucose-lowering agents in patients with T2DM, was also shown to improve CV and renal outcomes in the large, randomised, placebo-controlled EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial in patients with T2DM at high risk of CV events. The underlying mechanisms for the CV and renal protective effects of empagliflozin are not fully understood, but are likely to involve a combination of several mechanisms, including empagliflozin-associated body weight and blood pressure reductions, diuresis, a shift in substrate utilisation and activation of tubuloglomerular feedback. The results of ongoing CV outcomes trials with other SGLT2 inhibitors will potentially confirm whether the beneficial CV and renal effects observed in EMPA-REG OUTCOME are unique to empagliflozin or are a drug class effect."
137,28395981,2017,American journal of physiology. Renal physiology,Harnessing basic and clinic tools to evaluate SGLT2 inhibitor nephrotoxicity.,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of medications that target the transporter that reabsorbs ~90% of glucose in the S1 segment of the proximal convoluted tubule. As a result, SGLT2 inhibition increases urinary glucose excretion, effectively lowering plasma glucose levels. In addition to reducing hemoglobin A1c levels, these drugs also lower body weight, blood pressure, and uric acid levels in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Importantly, empagliflozin has been observed to slow progression of kidney disease and reduce dialysis requirements in T2DM patients. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) has collected over 100 cases of acute kidney injury (AKI) for canagloflozin and dapagliflozin since their approval. Of the 101 patients, 96 required hospitalization, 22 required intensive care unit admission, and 15 underwent hemodialysis. The FDA now requires that AKI be listed as a potential side effect of the SGLT2 inhibitors along with cautious prescription of these drugs with other medications, such as renin-angiotensin-system antagonists, diuretics, and NSAIDs. It is unclear, however, whether this FAERS reported ""AKI"" actually represents structural kidney injury, as randomized, controlled trials of these drugs do not describe AKI as an adverse event despite coprescription with RAS blockers and diuretics. As a result of this FDA warning, diabetic patients with early-stage CKD may not be prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor for fear of AKI. Thus, it is imperative to ascertain whether the reported AKI represents true structural kidney injury or a functional decline in glomerular filtration rate. We propose using readily available clinical tools with experimental biomarkers of kidney injury and kidney-on-a-chip technology to resolve this question and provide solid evidence about the AKI risk of these drugs for healthcare providers."
138,28637789,2015,The Diabetes educator,Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"The purpose of this review article is to provide guidance to clinicians and diabetes educators regarding the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors as a therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The PubMed database was searched through February 2015 to identify clinical trials and meta-analyses evaluating the use of the SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin administered as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetes drugs or with insulin. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce hyperglycemia in an insulin-independent manner by inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose into the systemic circulation by the kidneys. In patients with T2DM, SGLT2 inhibitors provide consistent reductions in glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma and postprandial glucose, body weight, and blood pressure when used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetes agents or with insulin. SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia, except when used with agents known to be associated with a higher risk of hypoglycemia, such as sulfonylureas or insulin. The unique renal-specific mechanism of action and favorable efficacy and safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors support consideration of these antidiabetes agents as a treatment option for patients with T2DM."
139,26450220,2019,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials on the Effect of SGLT2 Inhibitor on Blood Leptin and Adiponectin Level in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.,"Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new kind of hypoglycemic drugs that improve glucose homeostasis by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption. Recent studies have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors can also mediate body metabolism through regulation of adipokines level, but the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the concentration of adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) remains controversial. This meta-analysis was set out to evaluate the changes in circulating leptin and adiponectin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving SGLT2 inhibitors therapy. Ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs), that evaluated the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on blood leptin and adiponectin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, were identified by performing a systematic search of Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of science databases through July 2018. Data were calculated using a random-effects model and presented as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% conﬁdence interval (CI). Compared with placebo, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors contributed to a decreased circulating leptin levels (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.56, -0.03) and an increased circulating adiponectin levels (SMD 0.30, 95% CI 0.22, 0.38). SGLT2 inhibitor treatment was associated with decreased circulating leptin levels and increased circulating adiponectin levels, which might contribute to the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on metabolic homeostasis."
140,31408894,2015,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Sotagliflozin as a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"SGLT1 is the primary transporter responsible for the absorption of glucose and galactose in the intestine, while SGLT2 and SGLT1 are both involved in the renal reabsorption of glucose. SGLT2 inhibitors are a new class of oral antidiabetic drugs, acting by increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE). They offer the advantages of a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia, a decrease in body weight and blood pressure and an efficacy at all stages of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Herein, the authors focus specifically on sotagliflozin (LX4211), the first-in-class dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitor. Original publications in English were selected as the basis of this review. Clinical trials were identified using the Clinicaltrial.gov database. By a potential additional mechanism of action on intestinal glucose absorption linked to SGLT1 inhibition, sotagliflozin differentiates from SGLT2 inhibitors by reducing postprandial glucose excursion and insulin secretion, as well as by increasing GLP-1 secretion. Despite a weaker effect on UGE than selective SGLT2 inhibitors, sotagliflozin is as effective as SGLT2 inhibitors on HbA1C reduction, with a similar safety profile in short-term studies. While sotagliflozin was first assessed in T2DM, it is now in phase 3 development as an adjuvant treatment in patients with T1DM after positive results from a pilot study."
141,26548423,2016,Current medicinal chemistry,Recent Developments of C-Aryl Glucoside SGLT2 Inhibitors.,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is almost exclusively expressed in the proximal renal tubules. It is responsible for about 90% of the glucose reabsorption from tubular fluid. Selective inhibition of SGLT2 is expected to favor in the normalization of plasma glucose levels in T2DM patients through the prevention of renal glucose reabsorption and the promotion of glucose excretion from urine. Selective SGLT2 inhibitors have the merits to minimize the gastrointestinal side effects associated with SGLT1 inhibition, and selective SGLT2 inhibition may have a low risk of hypoglycemia. Since the C-aryl glucosides are metabolically more stable than the O-glucosides, numerous efforts have been made in the development of potent and selective C-aryl glucoside SGLT2 inhibitors, and a number of them are now used as anti-diabetes drugs in clinic or at various stages of clinical developments. Based on their structural features, in this review, these SGLT2 inhibitors are classified as three types: the phenyl/arylmethylphenyl C-glucosides, with an emphasis on the modifications on the proximal and/or the distal phenyl ring, and the spacer; the heteroarylmethylphenyl Cglucosides, with a replacement of the distal phenyl ring by a heterocycle like pyridazine, pyrimidine, thiophene and benzothiophene, thiazole, 1,3,4-thiadiazole, and triazolopyridinone; and the glucose-modified Caryl glucosides, including the glucose C-1 derived O-spiroketals, C-4 gem-difluoro analogues, C-5 and C-6 modified derivatives, dioxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane bridged ketals, the thioglucosides, and carbasugars. The structure-activity relationships (SARs) of each type along with their inhibitory potency against human SGLT2 and selectivity over human SGLT1 are discussed. "
142,26861002,2015,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,Canagliflozin: a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin is a novel treatment option for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In patients with hyperglycemia, SGLT2 inhibition lowers plasma glucose levels by reducing the renal threshold for glucose (RTG ) and increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE). Increased UGE is also associated with a mild osmotic diuresis and net caloric loss, which can lead to reductions in body weight and blood pressure (BP). After promising results from preclinical and phase I/II studies, the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin was evaluated in a comprehensive phase III development program in over 10,000 patients with T2DM on various background therapies. Canagliflozin improved glycemic control and provided reductions in body weight and BP versus placebo and active comparators in studies of up to 2 years' duration. Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated, with higher incidences of adverse events (AEs) related to the mechanism of action, including genital mycotic infections and AEs related to osmotic diuresis. Results from the preclinical and clinical studies led canagliflozin to be the first-in-class SGLT2 inhibitor approved in the United States, and support canagliflozin as a safe and effective therapeutic option across a broad range of patients with T2DM. "
143,26305874,2015,Current medical research and opinion,Renal effects of canagliflozin in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Chronic kidney disease is commonly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and may impact the efficacy and safety of glucose-lowering therapies. Canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, reduces blood glucose levels in patients with T2DM by lowering the renal threshold for glucose, thereby promoting urinary glucose excretion. This review describes the pharmacology, efficacy and safety of canagliflozin according to kidney function in participants with T2DM. Published articles that reported efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics data for canagliflozin in patients with T2DM and impaired renal function, and renal safety data with canagliflozin in various populations of patients with T2DM through May 2015 were included. Early transient reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate were observed with canagliflozin; these changes generally stabilized or attenuated over time and reversed after discontinuation, suggesting no renal (glomerular or tubular) damage with canagliflozin treatment. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios were reduced with canagliflozin. Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated in patients with normal or mild to moderately impaired renal function, with a modestly higher incidence of renal-related adverse events and volume depletion-related adverse events in patients with moderate renal impairment. Adverse events related to potassium elevations were infrequent with canagliflozin 100 mg regardless of kidney function status; however, patients with moderately impaired kidney function experienced hyperkalemia more frequently with canagliflozin 300 mg compared with patients treated with either canagliflozin 100 mg or placebo. Canagliflozin was not associated with increased cardiovascular risk across studies; however, relatively few events among patients with impaired renal function meant that the analysis was not adequately powered to examine this outcome, and results from separate trials are awaited. Overall, canagliflozin is associated with small, transient changes in kidney function, and is well tolerated in patients with T2DM with varying kidney function status."
144,26494163,2018,Diabetes research and clinical practice,SGLT2 inhibitors with cardiovascular benefits: Transforming clinical care in Type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Cardiovascular risk reduction in individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a key part of clinical management. Sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) inhibitors improve glycaemic control, reduce body weight and decrease blood pressure. In addition, the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin reduced the risk of composite cardiovascular events in high-risk individuals with T2DM in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and the CANVAS Program, respectively. Empagliflozin also reduced cardiovascular deaths and improved renal outcomes. This class of agents should be considered in people with established cardiovascular disease, usually in combination with other glucose lowering medications, when satisfactory glycaemic control has not been achieved. The dose of insulin or sulfonylureas may need to be lowered when used with SGLT2 inhibitors, to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Genitourinary infections can occur with SGLT2 inhibitors in a small proportion of people. In people with osteoporosis or prior amputation, it may be prudent to use empagliflozin rather than canagliflozin, based on the increased risk for bone fractures and amputations observed with canagliflozin in the CANVAS Program. SGLT2 inhibitors have the potential to transform the clinical care of persons with T2DM by not only improving glycaemic control but also reducing blood pressure, body weight and diabetes-related end-organ complications."
145,29196150,2017,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,Dapagliflozin: potential beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of renal and cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, a significant contributor to cardiovascular (CV) disease, responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Strategies to slow or prevent the onset and progression of diabetic kidney disease are critical for effectively managing T2DM and reducing CV risk. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are effective antidiabetic agents, which may provide nephroprotective and CV protective effects. Areas covered: This review examines the role of the kidney in glucose homeostasis, discusses renal hemodynamic changes in diabetes, and outlines the major hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying renal injury in diabetes. The potential benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in the prevention and treatment of CV complications in patients with T2DM are reviewed, with particular focus on dapagliflozin. Expert opinion: Dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors have the capacity to decrease hyperglycemia and visceral fat, components of the metabolic syndrome particularly associated with the progression of CV disease. However, the mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors resulting in their positive CV effects remain unclear. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart function in non-diabetic patients with decompensated heart failure remains to be explored."
146,28277831,2020,Diabetes research and clinical practice,Series: Implications of the recent CVOTs in type 2 diabetes: Impact on guidelines: The endocrinologist point of view.,"The management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) essentially consists in controlling hyperglycaemia, together with other vascular risk factors, in order to reduce the incidence and severity of diabetic complications. Whereas glucose control using classical glucose-lowering agents (except perhaps metformin) largely fails to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD), two new pharmacological classes, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), have proven their ability to reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with established CVD. Furthermore, SGLT2is reduced the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure and the progression of renal disease. According to the 2018 ADA-EASD consensus report, the choice of a second agent to be added to metformin should now be driven by the presence or not of atherosclerotic CVD, heart failure or renal disease, all conditions that should promote the use of a SGLT2i or a GLP-1 RA with proven efficacy. Thus endocrinologists have to face a new paradigm in the management of T2DM, with a shift from a primary objective of glucose control without inducing hypoglycaemia and weight gain to a goal of cardiovascular and renal protection, largely independent of glucose control. Of note, however, the latter remains crucial to reduce the risk of microangiopathy."
147,31108136,2016,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,SGLT2 inhibitors in the pipeline for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in Japan.,"Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in Japan since April 2014. The prescription rate in Japan is low in comparison to Western countries. We summarize the results obtained from the phase 3 clinical trials and clinical studies involving Japanese T2DM patients. We also discuss the current situation and the future prospects of SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan. Unexpected adverse events, such as cerebral infarction and diabetic ketoacidosis have been reported from clinics shortly after the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. However, the reductions in blood glucose levels and body weight have been demonstrated in phase 3 trials using 6 types of SGLT2 inhibitors, while observational studies of Japanese T2DM patients, which were performed in the clinical setting, showed that the incidence of adverse drug reactions, such as severe hypoglycemia, was low. SGLT2 inhibitors are also considered to be effective for treating Japanese patients with T2DM. When prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors, it is necessary to ensure that they are used appropriately because the Japanese T2DM patient population has a high proportion of elderly individuals and a high incidence of cerebrovascular disease."
148,27592508,2018,Expert opinion on drug safety,The safety of empagliflozin plus metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.,"Metformin is the first-line glucose-lowering medication in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but it generally requires soon or later the addition of a second-line therapy, among which a sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, to reach and maintain adequate glucose control. Areas covered: This narrative review provides an analysis of both efficacy and safety of a dual therapy combining metformin and empagliflozin, a SGLT-2 inhibitor that has proven its' potential to reduce major cardiovascular (CV) events, mortality, and renal outcomes in patients with T2DM and established CV disease. Pharmacokinetic studies showed the absence of drug-drug interactions and demonstrate bioequivalence between fixed-dose combination (FDC) and individual tablets of empagliflozin and metformin. Focus will be put on the use of this dual therapy in special populations. Expert opinion: The addition of empagliflozin to metformin therapy improves glucose control, with a minimal risk of hypoglycemia, while reducing body weight and arterial blood pressure. EMPA-REG OUTCOME showed that this combined therapy may be used in patients with established CV disease or heart failure. However, caution may be required in fragile elderly patients and in patients with severe impaired renal function. Further post-marketing surveillance is recommended to demonstrate long-term safety. FDC may improve adherence."
149,29593287,2019,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Comparison of the urinary glucose excretion contributions of SGLT2 and SGLT1: A quantitative systems pharmacology analysis in healthy individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.,"To develop a quantitative drug-disease systems model to investigate the paradox that sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT)2 is responsible for >80% of proximal tubule glucose reabsorption, yet SGLT2 inhibitor treatment results in only 30% to 50% less reabsorption in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A physiologically based four-compartment model of renal glucose filtration, reabsorption and excretion via SGLT1 and SGLT2 was developed as a system of ordinary differential equations using R/IQRtools. SGLT2 inhibitor pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were estimated from published concentration-time profiles in plasma and urine and from urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in healthy people and people with T2DM. The final model showed that higher renal glucose reabsorption in people with T2DM versus healthy people was associated with 54% and 28% greater transporter capacity for SGLT1 and SGLT2, respectively. Additionally, the analysis showed that UGE is highly dependent on mean plasma glucose and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and that their consideration is critical for interpreting clinical UGE findings. Quantitative drug-disease system modelling revealed mechanistic differences in renal glucose reabsorption and UGE between healthy people and those with T2DM, and clearly showed that SGLT2 inhibition significantly increased glucose available to SGLT1 downstream in the tubule. Importantly, we found that the findings of lower than expected UGE with SGLT2 inhibition are explained by the shift to SGLT1, which recovered additional glucose (~30% of total)."
150,30068236,2018,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,Clinical potential relevance of metabolic properties of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure.,"<b>Introduction</b>: Heart failure (HF) affects approximately 2% of the population worldwide, remaining a major cause of hospitalization and mortality despite innovative therapeutic approaches introduced in the past few decades. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) contributes significantly to end-organ damage and HF-related complications and is associated with worse clinical status and increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with HF with reduced (HFrEF) or with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), compared to HF patients without T2DM. Recently, a novel class of antidiabetic drugs has been introduced: sodium glucose co-trasport-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Initially designed for patients with T2DM to reduce kidney blood glucose resorption, SGLT2i rapidly gained attention among HF specialists since they were able to show a beneficial prognostic impact in patients affected by HF and T2DM, even independently from the glycemic control as suggested by the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials. <b>Areas covered</b>: The present review focuses on the mechanisms and the current clinical evidence supporting the use of SGLT2i in HF patients with T2DM. Moreover, the SGLT2i pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties will be presented in order to better understand the rationale and the design of the ongoing clinical trials investigating directly the effect of this new class of drugs in patients with HF, even independently from T2DM. <b>Expert opinion</b>: SGLT2i are emerging as an effective and safe therapy for the treatment of T2DM and current evidence has unexpectedly demonstrated a robust cardiovascular protection in HF patients with T2DM. Therefore, ongoing clinical trials are investigating directly the effect of this new class of drugs in patients with HF, even independently from T2DM. However, it is methodologically disappointing that the mechanisms underlying the encouraging results in cardiovascular protection of this drug class are still not fully understood. A better understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of SGLT2i is necessary in order to better determine the effect of this new class of drugs in patients with HF."
151,31423699,2018,Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,Do the SGLT-2 Inhibitors Offer More than Hypoglycemic Activity?,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common chronic health conditions in the USA; it affects approximately 10% of adults with up to one-quarter being undiagnosed. T2DM is associated with substantial cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. T2DM is a pathological condition characterized by elevated levels of glucose and associated with high CV risk. Traditional hypoglycemic drugs have demonstrated their capability for effective and maintained management of high glucose levels, but they have not significantly impacted on the incidence of CV events. Recently, a new class of hypoglycemic agents, SGLT-2 receptor inhibitors, has been developed. The EMPA-OUTCOME trial involving empagliflozin (a SGLT-2 receptor inhibitor) has shown significant reductions in major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure (HF) when administered on top of standard-of-care therapy for T2DM patients at high CV risk. The dramatic change driving the superiority of the primary composite outcome (major adverse CV events) was a significantly lower CV death rate (38% relative risk reduction). In addition, there were also an impressive 35 and 32% relative risk reductions in hospitalization for heart failure (HF) and death from any cause, respectively. These effects are even more important given the difficulties for treating concomitant HF in T2DM patients. These surprising results have been also corroborated by another agent of this class, canagliflozin, and the CANVAS trial. The magnitude of these somehow surprising cardiac benefits attained in the absence of major differences in glycemic, lipid, or blood pressure (BP) control has led to several groups to suggest that these benefits may be independent of its hypoglycemic activity and whether this new class could be considered a ""cardiac"" drug. The objective of this review has been to review the different hypotheses proposed to explain the cardiac benefits of this new class of antidiabetic drugs."
152,30472914,2019,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,An update of SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitors in early phase diabetes-type 2 clinical trials.,"<b>Introduction</b>: More than 424 million adults have diabetes mellitus (DM). This number is expected to increase to 626 million by 2045. The majority (90-95%) of people with DM has type 2-diabetes (T2DM). The continued prevalence of DM and associated complications has prompted investigators to find new therapies. One of the most recent additions to the anti-diabetic armamentarium are inhibitors of sodium-glucose co-transporters 1 and 2 (SGLT1, SGLT2). <b>Areas covered</b>: The authors review the status of SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of T2DM and place an emphasis on those agents in early phase clinical trials. Data and information were retrieved from American Diabetes Association, Diabetes UK, ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and Scopus websites. The keywords used in the search were T2DM, SGLT1, SGLT2, and clinical trials. <b>Expert opinion</b>: The benefits of SGLT inhibitors include reductions in serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, blood pressure and cardiovascular and renal events. However, SGLT inhibitors increase the risk of genitourinary tract infections, diabetic ketoacidosis, and bone fractures. The development of SGLT inhibitors with fewer side effects and as combination therapies are the key to maximizing the therapeutic effects of this important class of anti-diabetic drug."

Treatment of these patients with traditional as well as newer glucose-lowering drugs has not demonstrated superiority in CV outcomes compared to placebo, despite effective control of diabetes. However, the recently FDA-approved sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for the treatment of T2DM have demonstrated promising CV-protecting and blood pressure-lowering effects in addition to their effectiveness in glucose lowering, making them a novel class of drugs for the treatment of T2DM. So far, there are three SGLT2 inhibitors approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of T2DM: canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. They exert their antihyperglycemic effect through inhibition of SGLT2 in the kidney and significantly reduce glucose reabsorption from the proximal renal tubule. By blocking glucose reabsorption, they lead to loss of calories, weight, abdominal and total body fat, blood pressure and CV complications. One CV outcomes randomized trial and several short-term studies have shown reductions in CV events and blood pressure in patients with T2DM. It is the hope that large ongoing long-term outcome studies will provide further much-needed information, when they are completed."
154,31402716,2016,Postgraduate medicine,Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and cardiovascular outcomes.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, many patients with T2DM have comorbidities that are risk factors for CV disease. While intensive glucose control reduces the risk of diabetic microvascular complications, its relationship to CV outcomes remains unclear. Consequently, the management of CV risk factors in patients with T2DM is complex, and factors other than blood glucose must be considered. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a class of oral glucose-lowering agents, are associated with reductions in blood pressure and body weight, in addition to decreasing hyperglycemia, and therefore have the potential to reduce CV risk in patients with T2DM. The clinical trial results of SGLT2 inhibitors regarding CV safety and outcomes are discussed, including data from the recently published EMPA-REG OUTCOME study. This trial was the first dedicated CV outcomes study to demonstrate that a glucose-lowering agent lowered CV mortality and all-cause mortality, and reduced hospitalization for heart failure in patients with T2DM at high risk of CV events.

The effects of empagliflozin in lowering the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in T2DM patients with high cardiovascular risk during the recent Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial may be explained principally in terms of changes to cardiovascular physiology; namely, by the potential ability of empagliflozin to reduce cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen consumption by lowering blood pressure, improving aortic compliance, and improving ventricular arterial coupling. These concepts and hypotheses are discussed in this report."

The review focuses on the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics(PD) and clinical studies published on DAPA. The authors searched PubMed database for English language studies describing DAPA characteristics and use in T2DM subjects published through June 2014. DAPA exhibits favorable PK and PD properties and is effective in reducing glycemic levels. In addition, DAPA shows beneficial/neutral effects on other risk factors contributing to T2DM metabolic control. Increased risk of genital and urinary infections and episodes of volume depletion represent the major concerns for its use. FDA requires additional data to assess imbalances in bladder cancer and drug cardiovascular safety. The mechanism of action and the very low risk of drug-drug interaction make it an ideal drug for rapidly reducing glucotoxicity and restoring clinical response to other antidiabetic drugs."

In clinical trials, empagliflozin demonstrated significant improvements in glycemic control, as monotherapy and in combination regimens. In addition, empagliflozin was associated with weight loss and moderate reductions in blood pressure. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of the composite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke. Across the trials in general, empagliflozin was well tolerated, with no increased risk of hypoglycemia except when used with an insulin secretagogue or insulin. An increased risk of genital infections and urinary tract infections has been reported, although the association is less clear for urinary tract infections. Overall, empagliflozin appears to be a promising treatment for T2DM. "

It has been proposed that these agents could induce acute renal failure (ARF) under certain conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the association between SGLT2-inhibitors and ARF in the FDA adverse event report system (FAERS) database. We analyzed adverse event cases submitted to FAERS between January 2013 and September 2016. ARF cases were identified using a structured medical query. Medications were identified using both brand and generic names. During the period evaluated, 18,915 reports (out of a total of 3,832,015 registered in FAERS) involved the use of SGLT2-inhibitors. SGLT2-inhibitors were reportedly associated with ARF in 1224 of these cases (6.4%), and were defined as the ""primary"" or ""secondary"" cause of the adverse event in 96.8% of these cases. The proportion of reports with ARF among reports with SGLT2 inhibitor was almost three-fold higher compared to reports without these drugs (ROR 2.88, 95% CI 2.71-3.05, p < 0.001). The proportion of ARF reports among cases with SGLT2-inhibitors was significantly greater than the proportion of ARF among cases with T2DM without SGLT2-inhibitors (ROR 1.68, 95% CI 1.57-1.8, p < 0.001). Among the SGLT2-inhibitors, canagliflozin was associated with a higher proportion of reports of renal failure (7.3%), compared to empagliflozin and dapagliflozin (4.7% and 4.8% respectively, p < 0.001). SGLT2-inhibitors are associated with an increase in the proportion of reports of ARF compared to other medications. SGLT2-inhibitor agents may differ from one another in their respective risk for ARF."
159,26488032,2015,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,Better response to the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in young adults with type 2 diabetes.,"A variation of the response to Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors with age has not been investigated in patients with diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess renal threshold of glucose (RTg) before and after administration of an SGLT2 inhibitor in young adult patients (≤40 years) and older adult patients (>40 years) with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Twenty Japanese patients with T2DM were enrolled. Baseline data were obtained on the first day and dapagliflozin (5 mg) was administered at 6:00 on the second day. Glucose excursions were assessed by continuous glucose monitoring and urine samples were collected every hour during the daytime (7:00 to 15:00) on both days. RTg was estimated from the regression line of the scatter plot of the hourly mean glucose concentrations. After a single dose of dapagliflozin, RTg decreased from 121.5 to 6.1 mg/dl in the young adult group and from 151.0 mg/dl to -15.8 mg/dl in the older group. After dapagliflozin, the slope of the regression line was significantly steeper in the young adult group. Dapagliflozin was more effective in young patients because they showed a larger response of urinary glucose excretion."

We measured SGLT2 and SGLT1 expression in unaffected renal tissue from 19 people with T2DM and 20 people without diabetes, matched for age and estimated glomerular filtration rate (controls), undergoing unilateral nephrectomy. Expression of SGLT2 and SGLT1, as well as that of GLUT2 and GLUT1, was quantified using real-time and digital PCR; an affinity-purified antibody against human SGLT2 was used to localize SGLT2 by immunohistochemistry. SGLT2 expression was higher in control than T2DM tissue (median [interquartile range] target/β-actin 1.62 [2.02] vs 0.67 [0.61]; P < .0001), and SGLT1 trended in the same direction (0.98 [1.19] vs 0.44 [0.48]; P = .08). Immunohistochemistry clearly localized SGLT2 to the tubular brush-border membranes, and was semi-quantitatively stronger in control than T2DM tissue (5.0 [1.0] vs 4.0 [1.0] score units; P = .043). GLUT2 (control vs T2DM: 1.00 [0.69] vs 0.49 [0.36]) and GLUT1 expression (control vs T2DM: 0.86 [0.73] vs 0.35 [0.30]; P = .0007 for both) were closely correlated with those of the respective SGLT partner. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, more abundant in control than T2DM tissue, might be a transcription factor involved in the modulation of SGLT2 expression. In whole renal tissue, expressions of SGLT2/GLUT2 and SGLT1/GLUT1 are coupled and slightly lower in typical people with T2DM as compared with well-matched people without diabetes."
161,26479189,2017,Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,The Role of SGLT-2 Inhibitors as Part of Optimal Medical Therapy in Improving Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Diabetes and Coronary Artery Disease.,"The optimal treatment approach to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), including those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has been extensively evaluated. Several trials of stable ischemic heart disease including patients with T2DM have demonstrated that medical management is comparable to revascularization in terms of mortality and rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). There has been a growing appreciation for optimal medical therapy's (OMT) role in improving clinical outcomes. It is vital to target T2DM patients to prevent or delay MACE events through advanced OMT, ultimately delaying if not avoiding the need for revascularization. There has been significant evolution in the development of pharmacologic management of T2DM patients. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new pharmacologic therapy with tremendous potential to alter clinical practice and influence practice guidelines. SGLT2-inhibitors have great potential in reducing MACE in patients with T2DM and CAD. Empagliflozin should be considered as a part of OMT among these patients. If results similar to the EMPA-REG OUTCOMES trial are replicated in other trials, the use of these pharmacologic agents as a part of OMT may narrow the gap between revascularization and OMT alone in patients with T2DM and multi-vessel disease. Future studies on the role of SLGT-2 inhibitors with regard to heart failure outcomes are needed to elucidate the mechanisms and clinical effects in this vulnerable population."

With appropriate therapy, patients can lead full, healthy lives with the disease, so making informed decisions regarding pharmacotherapy for T2DM is clearly of great importance. "
163,28536852,2020,Postgraduate medicine,Impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors-induced glucosuria in the incidence of urogenital infection on postmenopausal women with diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in postmenopausal women is associated with a high incidence of urogenital infections, which negatively impact the quality of life and increase morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs. Glucosuria is a known risk factor for these infections; therefore, it is of interest to determine if increased glucosuria secondary to sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2in) impacts the incidence and severity of urogenital infections in postmenopausal women with T2DM. The study was conducted at Gaffrée Guinle University Hospital on two groups of postmenopausal women with T2DM: with and without SGLT2in therapy (n = 80 in each group). Medical records and laboratory parameters (urinary dipstick test and culture; blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and creatinine; cervical cytologic study) of all subjects were carefully assessed at baseline and thrice during the 12-month study period. We observed a significant incidence of vulvovaginitis (relative risk [RR], 2.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-5.10; <i>P</i> = 0.03) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (RR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.09-5.60; <i>P</i> = 0.03), but not of urinary tract infections (RR, 2.08; 95% CI, 0.74-5.81; <i>P</i> = 0.16), secondary to SGLT2in therapy. Genital infection was severe enough to warrant treatment discontinuation in 57.89% of patients in group 1. All urinary tract infections were of mild intensity with a good response to antibiotic therapy. Glucosuria induced by SGLT2in therapy may lead to a high incidence of urogenital infections in postmenopausal women with T2DM and can be considered a risk factor for these infections."

This retrospective study analyzed routinely collected health care records of ∼160 medical institutions in Japan from April 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017/2018 (varying at the institutional level). Adults with T2DM but without end-stage renal disease who initiated either SGLT2i or other classes of glucose-lowering medications (o-GLM) were matched using propensity score. The primary outcome was the time course of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) displayed in spline curve. The composite of renal worsening (>40% decline in eGFR) and the development of eGFR<30 mL/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> per minute was evaluated as a secondary outcome. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the robustness of results. We compared a matched cohort of 1433 SGLT2i users and 2739 o-GLM users (mean age: 61 years). The eGFR declined over time in both groups during the observation period (median: 17 months; maximum: 54 months), with a slower eGFR slope observed in SGLT2i users. This slower decline was consistently observed across different SGLT2i agents and different baseline eGFR groups. The cumulative incidence of composite renal endpoints was lower in the SGLT2i group with a hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.50-0.98; P=.039). Those findings were consistent in sensitivity analyses limited to the period adherent to the initial drug regimen and with a different approach for propensity score calculation. In a matched cohort of T2DM patients, SGLT2i use was associated with preserved renal function relative to o-GLM use over 2 to 4 years."

Some heterogeneity appears to exist between the various agents within the two pharmacological classes. Whether these positive results could be extrapolated to patients without cardiovascular disease is still unknown. The underlying mechanisms remain a matter of debate but appear to differ between SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs. One crucial question is which patient's characteristics should be taken into account to guide the choice between a SGLT2i or a GLP-1RA according to a personalized approach. Heart failure should encourage the use of a SGLT2i whereas moderate to severe chronic kidney disease should favour the prescription of a GLP-1RA. Despite the results of recent CVOTs, numerous patients who are good candidates for benefiting of these agents do not receive them in clinical practice. Currently, there is a paradigm shift in T2DM management, moving from a primary objective of glucose control to a cardiovascular and renal protection."

The inhibition of SGLT2-mediated glucose reabsorption is a novel and highly effective strategy to alleviate hyperglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy is diminished due, in part, to a compensatory increase in the maximum reabsorptive capacity (Tm) for glucose in patients with T2DM. We hypothesized that this increase in Tm could be explained by an increase in the tubular expression of SGLT and glucose transporters (GLUT) in these patients. To examine this, we obtained human kidney biopsy specimens from patients with or without T2DM and examined the mRNA expression of SGLTs and GLUTs. The expression of SGLT1 is markedly increased in the kidney of patients with T2DM, and SGLT1 mRNA is highly and significantly correlated with fasting and postprandial plasma glucose and HbA1c. In contrast, our data demonstrate that the levels of SGLT2 and GLUT2 mRNA are downregulated in diabetic patients, but not to a statistically significant level. These important findings are clinically significant and may have implications for the treatment of T2DM using strategies that target SGLT transporters in the kidney."

Rapid modernization and urbanization have led to major lifestyle changes and a tremendous increase in the prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus. The development of T2DM at a younger age, with lower body mass index, higher visceral adiposity, and more significant pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction compared to Caucasians are factors responsible for the increased prevalence of T2DM in East Asians. Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapaglifozin, empagliflozin, etc.) reduce renal glucose reabsorption, leading to favorable effects on glycemic, blood pressure, and weight control. The insulin-independent mechanism enables their use as monotherapy or combination therapy with insulin and other oral antidiabetic agents. The role of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of T2DM among East Asians is an interesting area of research, given that East Asians have been proven to be uniquely different from Caucasians. This review provides comprehensive coverage of the available literature not only on the efficacy and safety, but also on the recent cardiovascular and renal outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitors, focusing among East Asians."

SLC5A2 and HNF1A mutations are associated with renal glycosuria, but their contributions to renal glycosuria in patients with T2DM are not well understood. To assess the clinical features of patients with T2DM and renal glycosuria and those with T2DM and low urinary glucose excretion (LUGE) and identify variants in the exons of SLC5A2 and HNF1A in patients with renal glycosuria and T2DM. A total of 2044 Chinese patients with T2DM, including 64 patients with renal glycosuria and 58 patients with LUGE, were tested for their plasma and urine glucose concentrations after fasting. SLC5A2 and HNF1A exons were sequenced. Compared with patients with LUGE, those with renal glycosuria were younger (P = 0.008), had lower body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.002) and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) values (P < 0.0001), and were less likely to have hypertension (P = 0.006). HOMA-IR and BMI were negatively associated with renal glycosuria after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, and insulin therapy. One novel mutation (V359G) of SLC5A2 in 32 patients with renal glycosuria and one known mutation (R131W) of HNF1A in 28 nonobese patients with renal glycosuria were identified. These findings suggest that there are subtypes of T2DM characterized by different urinary glucose excretion and cardiovascular risk factors. SLC5A2 and HNF1A mutations partially explain renal glycosuria in patients with T2DM."

These trials show similarities in study design and definition of primary endpoints, but differ in their eligibility criteria. The aim of the present study was to investigate the generalizability of CVOTs on SGLT2i to Italian adults with T2DM; we estimated the proportions of this patient population who would be eligible for enrollment in EMPA-REG OUTCOME (empagliflozin), CANVAS (canagliflozin), DECLARE-TIMI 58 (dapagliflozin), and VERTIS-CV (ertugliflozin) studies. This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted in 222 Italian diabetes clinics. Data on 455,662 adult patients with T2DM seen during 2016 were analyzed against the published patient eligibility criteria for the four CVOTs. The current use of SGLT2i in potentially eligible patients was assessed. Among the population identified, the proportion of patients meeting major eligibility criteria was 11.7% for EMPA-REG OUTCOME, 29.4% for CANVAS, 55.9% for DECLARE-TIMI 58, and 12.8% for VERTIS-CV. Of the patients eligible for these CVOTs, only a minority (range 4.4-6.8%) was actually prescribed an SGLT2i. Compared with patients in the CVOTs, eligible patients in the real world showed older age and longer diabetes duration, lower BMI and HbA1c levels, lower prevalence of established cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and higher rates of microvascular complications and peripheral arterial disease. The percentage of patients potentially eligible for treatment with SGLT2i varies as a reflection of different eligibility criteria applied in the trials. A large number of patients that could benefit from SGLT2i in terms of not only cardiovascular protection but also renal protection do not receive the treatment. AstraZeneca."

The rapid increase in the number of newer therapies available makes the choice more difficult. Thus, we reviewed clinical trial evidence evaluating newer therapies available for treatment intensification beyond monotherapy. Head-to-head studies comparing newer therapies versus traditional (i.e., sulfonylurea) approaches consistently find lower incidence of hypoglycemia and weight gain with newer therapies. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors demonstrate high glycemic efficacy, while merits of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors include their tolerability. Secondary effects (weight loss, cardiovascular outcomes, renal function) are of growing interest with newer therapies. Choices for treatment intensification in T2DM diabetes are numerous. Understanding the comparative evidence of newer treatment choices, as provided in this review, may help guide clinical decision making."
172,31410779,2016,Acta diabetologica,Role of SGLT2 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"In the last ten years, knowledge on pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has significantly increased, with multiple failures (decreased incretin effect, increased lipolysis, increased glucagon secretion, neurotransmitters dysfunction) recognized as important contributors, together with decreased insulin secretion and reduced peripheral glucose uptake. As a consequence, the pharmacologic therapy of T2DM has been progressively enriched by several novel classes of drugs, trying to overcome these defects. The last, intriguing compounds come into the market are SGLT2 inhibitors, framing the kidney in a different scenario, not as site of a harmful disease complication, but rather as the means to correct hyperglycemia and fight the disease. This review aims to offer a short, updated overview of the role of these compounds in the treatment of T2DM, focusing on efficacy, ancillary albeit relevant clinical effects, safety, potential cardiovascular protection, positioning in common therapeutic algorithms."

HHF and all-cause healthcare costs per-patient-per-month (PPPM) were compared for patients initiated on canagliflozin and non-SGLT2i AHAs in the on-treatment analysis.<b>Results:</b> Baseline characteristics were well balanced between matched cohorts that included new users of canagliflozin or non-SGLT2i AHAs in the Truven (13,954 and 45,101, respectively) and Optum (11,490 and 53,360, respectively) databases. The mean (95% CI) PPPM cost of HHF was lower for canagliflozin than for non-SGLT2i AHAs in analyses of both the Truven ($21.31 [$21.25, $21.37]) and Optum ($30.43 [$30.41, $30.45]) databases. The mean (95% CI) PPPM all-cause healthcare cost was also lower for canagliflozin than for non-SGLT2i AHAs in analyses of both the Truven ($321 [$280, $361]) and Optum ($449 [$402, $495]) databases.<b>Limitations:</b> This study is subject to the limitations inherent to observational research including potential for coding errors and biases and unobserved confounding. Because all patients were in commercially administered health plans, these findings cannot be easily generalized to uninsured or Medicaid populations. Patient costs were evaluated up to and including their first HHF event. Post-discharge costs such as the costs of subsequent rehospitalizations were not included in this analysis.<b>Conclusions:</b> For patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease in this real-world study, treatment with canagliflozin was associated with lower HHF costs and all-cause healthcare costs compared with treatment with non-SGLT2i AHAs."

It is well known that all testosterone formulations may cause Hb and hematocrit increase, especially with short-acting injectable formulations. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are a new class of glucose-lowering agents that reduce hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion. The co-occurrence of T2DM and hypogonadism is known to be increasingly frequent. However, to date, no adverse events with the concomitant use of TRT and SGLT2is are reported. We report two cases of erythrocytosis during testosterone treatment and SGLT2i in patients with hypogonadism and T2DM. Considering that hypogonadism and T2DM are frequently associated, clinicians should carefully monitor the risk of occurrence of erythrocytosis when prescribing TRT and SGLT2i together."
175,31801393,2016,Postgraduate medicine,Impact of EMPA-REG OUTCOME<sup>®</sup> on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a review for primary care physicians.,"Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Most published trials of glucose-lowering agents have shown no significant CV benefit or increased risk of death or heart failure, with the exception of metformin. Three novel classes of glucose-lowering agents, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of T2DM in the United States and have also been available in other parts of the world in the past decade. Of the SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin has demonstrated a CV benefit in the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME®) while trials with other SGLT2 inhibitors are still ongoing. Empagliflozin has also provided possible renal protective benefit in those with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. The mechanisms behind the benefits seen with empagliflozin are likely multifactorial. Empagliflozin is the reasonable choice for add-on therapy in patients with long-standing T2DM who are at high CV risk as demonstrated in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® study."
176,30395251,2018,Current pharmaceutical design,Combination of SGLT-2 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Receptor Agonists: Potential Benefits in Surrogate and Hard Endpoints.,"The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is complex; only a few patients successfully attain glycemic targets with monotherapy, most requiring drug combination therapy. The goal of this review was to identify in PubMed the complimentary ways of action leading to clinical benefit (in lowering HbA1c, body weight, renal, and cardiac risk factors and events) of the combination of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA). SGLT2i, an emerging class of antidiabetic agents with an insulin-independent mechanism of action, are suitable for use in combination with any other class of antidiabetics, including insulin. The use of SGLT2i causes a reduction in Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) morbidity (mainly heart failure-HF) as well as total and CVD mortality. Besides insulin, SGLT2i may also be combined with incretin-based therapies, such as GLP-1 RA. The latter appears to reduce the rate or the progression of both macrovascular (mainly myocardial infarction-MI and stroke) and microvascular complications of DM, having a beneficial effect on all-cause mortality and CVD mortality, as well as CVD events. SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA may have a synergic effect on glucose reduction, weight reduction, renal impairment (both an independent lethal disease and a CVD risk factor) improvement, and cardiac event reduction, because the first reduces HF and related events and the second decreases CVD risk (mainly MI and stroke). Both also reduce total mortality, especially when combined with a statin. The combination of metformin with SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and a potent statin, in high CVD risk patients with DM, is expected to substantially reduce CVD mortality and morbidity, improving the quality of life of patients with DM at the same time. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding."

This study characterized single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of henagliflozin in Chinese patients with T2DM. Thirty T2DM patients were randomized in a 4:1 ratio to orally receive either henagliflozin 5, 10, 20 mg/day or placebo for 10 days, except on day 2 and day 3. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were measured on day 1 and day 10. Henagliflozin exhibited dose-proportional plasma concentrations with a half-life ranging from 9.1 to 14 h. Steady-state plasma henagliflozin concentration was reached by day 7 in all active treatment groups. Henagliflozin decreased the 24-h mean plasma glucose by -0.3, -1.0 and -1.0 mmol/L with doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg on day 1, respectively. The corresponding values on day 10 were -0.8, -0.9 and -1.2 mmol/L. Twenty-four-hour urinary glucose excretion increased by 11, 65 and 82 times with doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg on day 1, respectively, with a similar trend on day 10. No treatment-related serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events occurred. The observed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of henagliflozin support a once-daily dosing regimen in Chinese T2DM patients."
178,29865997,2020,Heart and vessels,Mechanisms and prediction of short-term natriuretic effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor in heart failure patients coexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The mechanisms of the diuretic effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and its predictors in heart failure (HF) patients with coexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain under investigation. A total of 40 hospitalized HF patients with T2DM (68 ± 13 years old, male gender 63%) were prospectively enrolled and received ipragliflozin at a dose of 50 mg once daily after breakfast for at least 4 consecutive days. They underwent first-morning blood and urine tests, and 24-h urine tests before and after short-term ipragliflozin therapy. Daily urine volume significantly increased from 1365 ± 511 mL/day on day 0 to 1698 ± 595 mL/day on day 3 (P < 0.001), which resulted in significant decreases in body weight and plasma brain natriuretic peptide level. Changes in 24-h urine volume were strongly and independently correlated with changes in 24-h urine sodium excretion (r = 0.80, P < 0.001), but was not significantly correlated with those in 24-h urine sugar excretion (r = 0.29, P = 0.07). Lower concentration of first-morning urine sodium and higher loop diuretic dosage before ipragliflozin therapy were associated with urine volume increment with ipragliflozin therapy, and former retained its independent predictor (Odds ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99, P = 0.02). First-morning urine sodium ≤ 53 mEq/L and baseline loop diuretics ≥ 20 mg/day predicted increased urine volume on day 3 with high diagnostic accuracy. Ipragliflozin has acute natriuretic activity, and first-morning urine sodium and baseline dosage of loop diuretics strongly predicted the diuretic effects. Ipragliflozin therapy may restore responsiveness to loop diuretics in symptomatic HF patients with T2DM."
179,26692004,2017,Postgraduate medicine,"Bone effects of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), lowers blood glucose by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption and increasing urinary glucose excretion. It has been reported that SGLT2 inhibitors may have potential adverse effects on bone, including increased fracture risk and decreased bone mineral density (BMD). Across clinical studies, canagliflozin was not associated with meaningful changes in serum or urine calcium, vitamin D, or parathyroid hormone. Minimal increases in serum phosphate and magnesium that were within normal limits were seen with canagliflozin versus placebo. Canagliflozin was associated with increases in serum collagen type 1 beta-carboxy telopeptide (beta-CTX), a bone resorption marker, and osteocalcin, a bone formation marker. Decreases in total hip BMD were seen with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus placebo after 2 years (-1.7%, -2.1%, -0.8%; differences of -0.9% and -1.2%), but not at other skeletal sites (normal age-related bone loss, ~0.5-1.0%/year). Changes in beta-CTX and total hip BMD were significantly associated with weight loss, which is known to increase bone resorption markers and decrease BMD. Canagliflozin was associated with a higher fracture incidence in an interim analysis of the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) in patients with a history or high risk of cardiovascular disease (incidence per 100 patient-years of 1.6, 1.6, and 1.1 with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and placebo), but not in other clinical studies of patients with T2DM. Fractures tended to occur as early as 12 weeks after initiating treatment and were primarily located in the distal parts of the upper and lower extremities. The reason for increased fracture risk with canagliflozin treatment is unknown, but is likely not related to a direct effect of canagliflozin on bone-related biomarkers. Data from ongoing canagliflozin studies, including CANVAS, will provide additional information on fracture risk in patients with T2DM."
180,32270357,2019,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",The renoprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes with or without prevalent kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) concerning kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with or without prevalent kidney disease. PubMed, Web of science, Embase and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with SGLT2is versus placebo in patients with T2DM. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied for continuous variables, and the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% CI were used for dichotomous outcomes. Patients were categorized according to whether the baseline mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was less or was more than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> . A total of 25 eligible studies with 43 721 participants were included. There was an initial and small decrease in eGFR during the early treatment period (WMD, -4.63; 95% CI, -6.08 to -3.19 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> ), which was noted at 1-6 weeks and gradually narrowed over time, with a decline in protection from eGFR in the long term (WMD, 3.82; 95% CI, 2.80-4.85 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> ). SGLT2is significantly delayed albuminuria progression (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.66-0.76), promoted albuminuria regression (RR,1.71; 95% CI, 1.54-1.90), improved the composite of ≥40% decrease in eGFR, in the need for renal-replacement and in death from renal causes (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.49-0.66), and reduced all-cause mortality (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.94). At the same time, they significantly increased the risk of genital infection (RR, 3.43; 95% CI, 2.87-4.10) vs placebo in patients with T2DM. Meta-regression analyses showed that eGFR-preservation effects were not significantly associated with basic patient characteristics (age, BMI, HbA1c, eGFR level), but were influenced by drug administration (treatment duration, type, dosage of SGLT2is). Subgroup analyses showed that the relative effects on renal outcomes of SGLT2is vs placebo were similar across eGFR subgroups (P heterogeneity >0.05). SGLT2is slowed eGFR decline, lowered albuminuria progression, improved adverse renal endpoints and reduced all-cause mortality, but increased risk of genital infections vs placebo in patients with T2DM. The indication of consistent renal benefits across categories of baseline eGFR levels may allow additional individuals to benefit from SGLT2is therapy."
181,27894216,2015,International journal of clinical practice,Dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetes: effectiveness across the spectrum of disease and over time.,"Despite many available therapies, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently do not achieve/maintain glycaemic control. Furthermore, side effects such as hypoglycaemia and weight gain may limit therapy choices. Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, reduces hyperglycaemia by increasing glucosuria independently of insulin, representing a novel approach in T2DM. Dapagliflozin efficacy, safety and tolerability were evaluated across a wide range of clinical trials. Dapagliflozin 10-mg efficacy data from (i) two short-term, active-comparator studies (vs. metformin-XR over 24 weeks and vs. glipizide over 52 weeks), (ii) pooled 24-week analyses of five placebo-controlled trials (as monotherapy or add-on therapy), and (iii) long-term studies over 2 years; dapagliflozin 5- and 10-mg pooled safety data from 12 placebo-controlled trials; and cardiovascular safety and malignancy data from 19 dapagliflozin studies were evaluated. In treatment-naïve patients (baseline HbA1c 9%), dapagliflozin reduced HbA1c (-1.45%) similarly to metformin-XR (-1.44%). In metformin-treated patients (baseline HbA1c 7.7%), dapagliflozin achieved a clinically significant reduction (-0.52%) similar to glipizide (-0.52%). In pooled 24-week analyses, dapagliflozin vs. placebo differences in HbA1c, weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were -0.60%, -1.61 kg and -3.6 mmHg, respectively. At 2 years, dapagliflozin vs. placebo differences in HbA1c and weight were -0.44 to -0.80% and -2.41 to -3.19 kg, respectively, and vs. glipizide, differences in HbA1c, weight, and SBP were -0.18%, -5.06 kg, and -3.89 mmHg, respectively. Major hypoglycaemia with dapagliflozin was rare (< 0.1%). Urinary tract and genital infections were more common with dapagliflozin, but responded to standard care and rarely led to study discontinuation. Events of renal failure/impairment and malignancies were rare and balanced across treatment groups. Pooled analyses did not indicate that dapagliflozin increased cardiovascular event risk. Dapagliflozin improved glycaemic control, decreased body weight, and lowered blood pressure across the spectrum of T2DM disease, with maintenance of these benefits over time."
182,30565382,2020,Clinical drug investigation,Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors for Prevention of Heart Failure Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Cost Per Outcome Analysis.,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have significant efficacy in reducing the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (hHF) or cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there are differences in HF outcomes between the SGLT2i. Therefore, we compared the cost needed to achieve these outcomes between empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin. We calculated the cost needed to treat (CNT) in order to prevent one event of hHF or CV mortality, by multiplying the annualized number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one event, by the annual cost of each therapy. Efficacy estimates were extracted from published randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. A sensitivity analysis was performed to mitigate differences between the RCT populations. Drug costs were extracted from the 2020 US National Average Drug Acquisition Cost listing. We figured empagliflozin's CNT to be $664,464 (95% CI $499,872-$1,097,280), $1,535,387 (95% CI $886,074-$3,210,501) for canagliflozin, and $2,693,145 (95% CI $1,639,563-$11,092,206) for dapagliflozin. The sensitivity analysis confirmed the cost advantage of empagliflozin. Our findings suggest that empagliflozin prescribed for preventing CV death or hHF in T2DM patients seems to be cost saving compared to treatment with canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin."

Data for patients randomized to dapagliflozin 10mg or placebo with a history of HF were pooled from five clinical trials. HbA<sub>1c</sub>, weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP; two studies) were examined up to 52weeks using longitudinal repeated-measures models. Composite cardiovascular outcomes, hospitalizations for HF (HHF), and adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. Patients (mean age 64years, T2DM duration ~14years, HbA<sub>1c</sub> 8.2%, ~50% with New York Heart Association Class ≥II) received dapagliflozin (N=171) or placebo (N=149). Dapagliflozin produced clinically meaningful placebo-adjusted reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (-0.55%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.80, -0.30), weight (-2.67kg; 95% CI: -3.88, -1.47), and SBP (-2.05mmHg; 95% CI: -5.68, 1.57) over 52weeks. HHF was rare, but numerically lower with dapagliflozin (n=1 [0.6%]) vs placebo (n=7 [4.7%]). Point estimates for hazard ratios of composite cardiovascular outcomes favored dapagliflozin vs placebo, although 95% CIs crossed unity. Dapagliflozin produced clinically meaningful reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, weight, and SBP in patients with T2DM and HF, and was well tolerated."
184,32449083,2016,Current medical research and opinion,Practical considerations for the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitors in treating hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.,"Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of oral anti-diabetic agents with a unique, insulin-independent mode of action. In patients with diabetes who have adequate renal function, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce hyperglycemia by blocking renal glucose reabsorption and increasing urinary glucose excretion. These agents are indicated for the treatment of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as an adjunct to diet and exercise. In terms of efficacy, they are comparable to most other oral agents, and carry a low risk of hypoglycemia unless combined with sulfonylureas or insulin. They may be used in combination regimens with metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin. Beyond glucose lowering, SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with modest weight loss and mild anti-hypertensive effects. Emerging cardiovascular and renal outcomes data suggest other potentially beneficial non-glycemic effects, although these findings await confirmation from further studies. The main adverse effects are increased risk of volume depletion and of genitourinary infections, although these can be managed with standard interventions. Rare cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis have been reported in a subset of patients treated with these agents, an issue currently under investigation. SGLT2 inhibitors represent a promising alternative treatment option for T2DM patients in whom the effectiveness of oral anti-hyperglycemic therapy is limited by the risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, or other adverse effects. Safety and efficacy (up to 4 years) have been demonstrated in a range of T2DM patient populations, although more studies will be needed to determine whether treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors improves patient-important outcomes in the longer term."
185,28284707,2019,Current diabetes reviews,"Hormonal, Metabolic and Hemodynamic Adaptations to Glycosuria in Type 2 Diabetes Patients Treated with Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter Inhibitors.","The advent of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors [SGLT-2i] provides an additional tool to combat diabetes and complications. The use of SGLT-2i leads to effective and durable glycemic control with important reductions in body weight/fat and blood pressure. These agents may delay beta-cell deterioration and improve tissue insulin sensitivity, which might slow the progression of the disease. In response to glycosuria, a compensatory rise in endogenous glucose production, sustained by a decrease in plasma insulin with an increase in glucagon has been described. Other possible mediators have been implicated and preliminary findings suggest that a sympathoadrenal discharge and/or rapid elevation in circulating substrates (i.e., fatty acids) or some yet unidentified humoral factors may have a role in a renal-hepatic inter-organ relationship. A possible contribution of enhanced renal gluconeogenesis to glucose entry into the systemic circulation has not yet been ruled out. Additionally, tissue glucose utilization decreases, whereas adipose tissue lipolysis is stimulated and, there is a switch to lipid oxidation with the formation of ketone bodies; the risk for keto-acidosis may limit the use of SGLT-2i. These metabolic adaptations are part of a counter-regulatory response to avoid hypoglycemia and, as a result, limit the SGLT-2i therapeutic efficacy. Recent trials revealed important cardiovascular [CV] beneficial effects of SGLT-2i drugs when used in T2DM patients with CV disease. Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, there appears to be ""class effect"". Changes in hemodynamics and electrolyte/body fluid distribution are likely involved, but there is no evidence for anti-atherosclerotic effects. It is anticipated that, by providing durable diabetes control and reducing CV morbidity and mortality, the SGLT-2i class of drugs is destined to become a priority choice in diabetes management."

Treatment-related tumors were not seen in the 2-year mouse study. A cross-functional, mechanism-based approach was undertaken to determine whether the mechanisms responsible for tumorigenesis in the rat were of relevance to humans. Based on findings from nonclinical and clinical studies, the treatment-related tumors observed in rats were not deemed to be of clinical relevance. Here, we describe the scientific and regulatory journey from learning of the 2-year rat study findings to the approval of canagliflozin for the treatment of T2DM."

This study examined the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from eight Phase IIb/III double-blind trials of up to 24 weeks, treated with placebo (n = 497) or dapagliflozin 5 mg (n = 491) or 10 mg (n = 465). Efficacy was assessed in the pooled population receiving dapagliflozin 5, 10 mg or placebo over 24 weeks. Safety and tolerability were assessed by collating data for overall adverse events (AEs) and AEs of special interest over the 24-week period. Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Placebo-corrected adjusted mean changes from baseline at 24 weeks in the dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively, were -0.52% and -0.58% for HbA1c and -1.34 and -1.80 kg for body weight. Modest reductions in blood pressure were also noted with dapagliflozin. Overall, 56.5%, 53.6%, and 58.7% of patients in the placebo and dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively, experienced AEs, compared with 2.8%, 4.1%, and 2.4% experiencing serious AEs. Genital infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin 10 mg than placebo, whereas the pattern for urinary tract infections was less clear. A transient reduction in mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was noted with dapagliflozin, but was not associated with an increased frequency of serious renal AEs. In contrast, placebo-corrected reductions in urinary albumin : creatinine ratio in patients with albuminuria at baseline suggest a potential renoprotective effect of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin was efficacious and well tolerated in Asian patients with T2DM."
189,29608505,2018,Cardiovascular & hematological disorders drug targets,Sodium-glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors: Glucose Lowering Against other Hypoglycemic Agents.,"The treatment of diabetes remains challenging over the decades, even after the introduction of numerous novel drugs of different classes. Most patients with type 2 diabetes require a combination of multiple agents and eventually the use of insulin. The newest antidiabetic drugs, possibly with the most pleiotropic actions after metformin are the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (SGLT-2i). This class has a unique mechanism inhibiting the glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. The purpose of this review is to critically discuss the beneficial effect of SGLT-2i on glycemic control as monotherapy or in combination with other hypoglycemic agents. A systematic review of randomised clinical trials on SGLT-2i vs placebo, other glucoselowering drugs or insulin was performed, and studies assessing glycemic control, mainly expressed through glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose levels (FPG) were included in the review. Electronic and manual searches on MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were performed. In our review, we mainly focused on dapagliflozin, empaglifozin and canagliflozin. All agents exhibited a sufficient reduction of HbA1c as well as FPG. SGLT-2i are a reliable second-line therapy of T2DM, since they can be combined safely with metformin, sulfonylures, incretin mimetics, insulin as well as in triple combinations. In many studies, they were prioritised as monotherapy with satisfying effects regarding HbA1c and FPG level reductions."
190,27625142,2018,Current diabetes reports,Implications of the CANVAS Study in Reducing Cardiovascular Outcomes.,"In recent years, Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trials (CVOTs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have demonstrated that sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) could reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and cardiovascular mortality independent of a glucose lowering mechanism. SGLT2i trials reported significant results that have generated biologically plausible theories with regard to the macrovascular benefit. In this review, we have summarized and discussed the results of the CANVAS program. The CANVAS program is unique as it is an analysis of two aggregated cohorts. The two cohorts were similar at baseline but had different durations of exposure to canagliflozin. It showed a 14% reduction in the primary MACE composite. However, the individual components of the MACE composite were not significantly different from placebo. Initial analysis also indicated a reno-protective effect. The results of the CANVAS program are similar overall yet different when compared to the EMPA-REG OUTCOMES trial, especially with regard to cardiovascular mortality and adverse event profile. This could possibly be due to the differences in the cardiovascular risk profile of the enrolled population in the two trials. Other possibilities include drug-specific effects and different mechanisms of lowering overall MACE. In addition, a brief comparison of CANVAS to the CVD-REAL indicates that the CANVAS trial results may apply to a larger, more generalized population than those in the CANVAS program."
191,29412124,2015,The Medical clinics of North America,Oral antihyperglycemic treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Table 3 provides an overview of the oral antihyperglycemic drugs reviewed in this article. A 2011 meta-analysis by Bennett and colleagues found low or insufficient quality of evidence favoring an initial choice of metformin, SUs, glinides, TZDs, or (table see text) DPP-4 inhibitors (alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, bromocriptine mesylate, and SGLT2 inhibitors were not included in this meta-analysis) with regard to the outcomes measures of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events and mortality, and incidence of microvascular disease (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) in previously healthy individuals with newly diagnosed T2DM. Likewise, the Bennett and colleagues meta-analysis judged these drugs to be of roughly equal efficacy with regard to reduction of HbA1c (1%–1.6%) from the pretreatment baseline. The ADOPT clinical trial of 3 different and, at the time, popular, oral monotherapies for T2DM provides support for the consensus recommendation of metformin as first-line therapy. The ADOPT trial showed slightly superior HbA1c reduction for rosiglitazone compared with metformin, which was in turn superior to glyburide. However, significant adverse events, including edema, weight gain, and fractures, were more common in the rosiglitazone-treated patients. The implication of this trial is that the combination of low cost, low risk, minimal adverse effects, and efficacy of metformin justifies use of this agent as the cornerstone of oral drug treatment of T2DM. Judicious use of metformin in groups formerly thought to be at high risk for lactic acidosis (ie, those with CHF, chronic kidney disease [eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73 m2], and the elderly) may be associated with mortality benefit rather than increased risk. Secondary and tertiary add-on drug therapy should be individualized based on cost, personal preferences, and overall treatment goals, taking into account the wishes and priorities of the patient."

193,25456645,2016,Postgraduate medicine,Dapagliflozin combination therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease, and most patients ultimately require two or more antidiabetes drugs in addition to lifestyle changes to achieve and maintain glycemic control. Current consensus statements and guidelines recommend metformin as first-line pharmacotherapy for the treatment of T2DM in most patients. When glycemic control cannot be maintained with metformin alone, the sequential, stepwise addition of other agents is recommended. Agents such as thiazolidinediones or sulfonylureas have typically been added to metformin therapy. Although effective in reducing glycated hemoglobin, these drugs are often associated with adverse effects, most notably weight gain, and in the case of sulfonylureas, hypoglycemia. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin, are the newest class of antidiabetes drugs approved for the treatment of T2DM. Dapagliflozin effectively improves glycemic control by increasing the renal excretion of excess glucose. In clinical trials, dapagliflozin has been well tolerated and has additional benefits of weight loss, low risk of hypoglycemia and reduction in blood pressure. This review discusses the clinical evidence and rationale for the use of dapagliflozin as add-on therapy in T2DM. The results suggest that dapagliflozin add-on therapy is a promising new treatment option for a wide range of patients with T2DM. Results from an ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial are needed to establish the long-term safety of dapagliflozin. "

Owing to this, it induced glucosuria and cause changes in glucose homeostasis without affecting insulin. This review addressed the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in a specialized patients such as chronic kidney disease (stage III CKD), high risk cardiovascular patient and elderly population. Canagliflozin has reduced HbA1c in all the specialized population, albeit reduction is less as compared to the normal cohort. Additionally, canagliflozin causes reduction in body weight as well as in blood pressure. It was very well tolerated and did not produce significant adverse events compared to standard care (placebo) except genital mycotic infection due to glucosuria. In cardio vascular safety analysis, canagliflozin might be associated with increased incidence of major adverse cardiovascular plus (MACE plus) events in the initial period, which is of concern in a high- risk cardiovascular cohort. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM) and stage III CKD cohort, canagliflozin was well tolerated without much affecting eGFR and should be initiated with 100mg. Canagliflozin showed good safety profile in elderly population with T2DM without significantly affecting overall bone mineral density and bone resorption. "

SGLT-2I inhibits renal glucose reabsorption, thereby ensuing urinary glucose excretion in a dose-dependent manner. This caloric loss and osmotic diuresis, secondary to increased urinary glucose excretion, has a unique potential to counter insulin induced weight gain and fluid retention, with little potential of hypoglycemic exacerbation. Also, as these agents act independently of insulin secretion or action, they are effective even in long-standing diabetes with depleted β-cell reserve. Improvement in insulin sensitivity, as observed with SGLT-2I can also facilitate insulin action. Furthermore, significant reduction in total daily insulin dosage and reduction of body weight as observed during combination therapy renders SGLT-2I, a near-ideal partner to insulin. This review aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of currently used SGLT-2I as an add-on to insulin therapy in the treatment of T2DM. "
198,26549321,2019,Journal of medical economics,Economic modelling of costs associated with outcomes reported for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in the CANVAS and EMPA-REG cardiovascular outcomes trials.,"To model direct medical costs associated with reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in T2DM patients reported in the CANVAS and EMPA-REG trials, which assessed the cardiovascular safety of canagliflozin and empagliflozin, respectively. Costs were modeled from a US managed care organization (MCO) perspective for the CVD outcomes included in both trials: three-point major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and its components (cardiovascular-related death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke), as well as heart failure requiring hospitalization. The rate of CVD events averted (difference between study drug and placebo) was projected to the portion of an MCO T2DM population matching the respective trial's inclusion criteria. A targeted literature search for paid amounts directly associated with each CVD event provided the unit costs, which were applied to the projected number of events averted, to calculate costs avoided per member per year (PMPY). One-way sensitivity analyses were performed on events averted, unit costs, and percentages of trial-applicable patients. Based on three-point MACE events averted, costs avoided PMPY of $6.17 (range: $1.27-$10.94) for CANVAS and $2.75 ($0.19-$4.83) for EMPA-REG were estimated. Costs avoided for individual components of MACE ranged from $0.77 to $3.84 PMPY for CANVAS and from -$0.97 (additional costs) to $1.54 for EMPA-REG. PMPY costs avoided for heart failure were $2.72 for CANVAS and $1.32 for EMPA-REG. Models assumed independent, non-recurrent outcomes and were restricted to medical costs directly associated with the trial-reported events. The reductions in CVD events in T2DM patients reported for both CANVAS and EMPA-REG project to a positive cost avoidance for these events in an MCO population. The analysis did not include an assessment of the impact on total cost, as the costs associated with adverse events, drug utilization or other clinical outcomes were not examined."

The aim was to evaluate the lipid effects of dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo in patients with T2DM with/without baseline elevated triglyceride and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. This was a post hoc analysis of 10 phase 3, placebo-controlled studies of dapagliflozin 10 mg (N = 2237) or placebo (N = 2164) administered for 24 weeks in patients with T2DM.

The reference group (group B) included patients who did not meet the defined lipid criteria. The effects of dapagliflozin on fasting lipid profiles were generally similar in the 2 lipid groups (ie, groups A and B) and, compared with placebo, were associated with minor increases in non-HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and HDL cholesterol levels. The effects on triglyceride levels were inconsistent. The incidence of adverse events (AEs)/serious AEs, and AEs of genital infection, urinary tract infection, volume reduction, renal function, and hypoglycemia were similar in the 2 lipid groups. Patients with T2DM treated with dapagliflozin experienced minor changes in lipid levels; the changes were generally similar in the 2 lipid groups. The clinical significance of these changes in lipids is unclear, especially in view of the positive effects of dapagliflozin on other cardiovascular disease risk factors."
200,30575426,2018,Journal of clinical pharmacology,Population Pharmacokinetic- Pharmacodynamic Analysis to Characterize the Effect of Empagliflozin on Renal Glucose Threshold in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion (UGE) by lowering the renal threshold for glucose (RT<sub>G</sub> ). We aimed to quantify the effect of the sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitor empagliflozin on renal glucose reabsorption in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using a mechanistic population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model and to compare results with analyses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The PK-PD model was developed using data from a randomized phase 2 study in which patients with T1DM received oral once-daily empagliflozin 2.5 mg, empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo as an adjunct to insulin. The model assumed that UGE was dependent on plasma glucose and renal function and that empagliflozin lowered RT<sub>G</sub> . The final model was evaluated using visual predictive checks and found to be consistent with observed data. Calculated RT<sub>G</sub> with placebo was 181 mg/dL, and with empagliflozin (steady state) 1 mg and 2.5 mg was 53.4 mg/dL and 12.5 mg/dL, respectively. Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg yielded negative RT<sub>G</sub> values, implying RT<sub>G</sub> was reduced to a negligible value. Although estimated PK-PD parameters were generally comparable between patients with T1DM and patients with T2DM, slight differences were evident, leading to lower RT<sub>G</sub> and higher UGE in patients with T1DM compared with patients with T2DM. In conclusion, the model provided a reasonable description of UGE in response to administration of empagliflozin and placebo in patients with T1DM."

PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for studies published up to May 24, 2016, without language or date restrictions. Randomized trials that reported at least 1 renal-related adverse outcome in patients with T2DM treated with SGLT2 inhibitors were included. Pairwise and network meta-analyses were carried out to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and a cumulative meta-analysis was performed to assess the robustness of evidence. In total, we extracted 1334 composite renal events among 39 741 patients from 58 trials, and 511 acute renal impairment/failure events among 36 716 patients from 53 trials. Dapagliflozin was significantly associated with a greater risk of composite renal events than placebo (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.26-2.13). Empagliflozin seemed to confer a lower risk than placebo (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.54-0.72), canagliflozin (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29-0.82) and dapagliflozin (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28-0.51). With regard to acute renal impairment/failure, only empagliflozin was significantly associated with a lower risk than placebo (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.86). The cumulative meta-analysis indicated the robustness of our significant findings. The present meta-analysis indicated that dapagliflozin may increase the risk of adverse renal events, while empagliflozin may have a protective effect among patients with T2DM. Further data from large well-conducted randomized controlled trials and a real-world setting are warranted."
202,29251772,2017,Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,The Effect of Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) Inhibitors on Cardiometabolic Profile; Beyond the Hypoglycaemic Action.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has growing prevalence worldwide and major clinical implications, chiefly cardiovascular (CV) and renal disease burden. Sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors are a new drug class in the management of T2DM with a mechanism of action independent of insulin. In addition to their hypoglycaemic effect, SGLT-2 inhibitors appear to have haemodynamic and nephroprotective effects. Studies have consistently showed a modest but significant blood pressure (BP) reduction. Metabolic benefits are also attributed to SGLT-2 inhibitors with a modest but consistent body weight decrease recorded along with improvements in lipid profile and uric acid levels. Remarkable findings of significant cardioprotective effects came from the recent EMPA-REG study with a particular focus on heart failure. In the kidney, SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce hyperfiltration, a precipitant of diabetic nephropathy."
203,28240446,2018,Cardiovascular & hematological disorders drug targets,Sodium-glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors and Ischemic Stroke.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with substantially increased risk for cardiovascular events, including ischemic stroke. In turn, ischemic stroke represents a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide. The recent class of glucose-lowering agents is sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, which act through inhibition of glucose reabsorption in the kidney, resulting in glucose excretion without stimulating insulin release. Accumulating data suggests that these agents improve multiple risk factors for ischemic stroke except their glucose-lowering effect. In the present review, the pleiotropic actions of SGLT-2 inhibitors are summarized and their potential implications on ischemic stroke prevention are discussed. We performed a comprehensive search of the literature in terms of SGLT-2 inhibitors efficacy on ischemic stroke and traditional risk factors of cerebrovascular disease. Several studies consistently showed that SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce blood pressure, induce weight loss, increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and reduce triglyceride levels. In addition, they improve several emerging cardiovascular risk factors, most notably arterial stiffness, albuminuria and oxidative stress. However, in the only trial that evaluated the effects of these agents on the incidence of ischemic stroke, empagliflozin did not reduce the risk of first or recurrent stroke despite a significant reduction in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Despite the multiple pleiotropic effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors, these agents do not appear to affect stroke risk. Ongoing large trials with longer follow-up will evaluate whether the pleiotropic effects of this class will translate into benefits in ischemic stroke prevention."

Health outcomes were simulated using the validated Economic and Health Outcomes Model of T2DM. Patient demographic characteristics, biomarker values, and treatment effects were sourced from a subgroup of Indian patients enrolled in a 52-week, head-to-head study of canagliflozin versus glimepiride (mean maximum dose of 5.6 mg/d) in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin. Outcomes were discounted at 5%. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using alternative values for key model inputs. Relative to glimepiride, treatment with canagliflozin 100 mg was associated with approximately 14 more patients surviving at year 20 per 1,000 patients treated and 0.43 quality-adjusted life-years gained, largely because of improved body weight and reduced risk of macrovascular and microvascular morbidity over 20 years. Risk reductions were the largest for microvascular complications (e.g., chronic kidney disease and albuminuria). Improved health outcomes were driven by better glycated hemoglobin control associated with canagliflozin versus glimepiride, which also delayed the need for rescue therapy. Key components of quality-adjusted life-year gains included the avoidance of hypoglycemic episodes, chronic kidney disease, and weight gain, as well as increased survival with canagliflozin compared with glimepiride. Simulation results suggest that canagliflozin 100 mg may provide better long-term health outcomes compared with glimepiride in Indian patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin."

Adverse events (AEs) were assessed descriptively in patients who took ≥1 dose of the study drug. AE incidence rates per 100 patient-years were calculated to adjust for differences in drug exposure across trials. Total exposure was 3254, 3840, and 5649 patient-years in the placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg groups, respectively. The incidence of any AEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, severe AEs, and serious AEs was no higher in patients treated with empagliflozin than with placebo. Empagliflozin was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia versus placebo, except in patients on background sulfonylurea and/or insulin. The incidence of events consistent with urinary tract infection was similar across treatment groups (9.4-11.3/100 patient-years); 0.4%, 0.2%, and 0.3% of patients in the placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg groups, respectively, had urinary tract infections that required or prolonged hospitalization. The incidence of events consistent with genital infection was higher in patients treated with empagliflozin (4.7 and 5.0/100 patient-years for empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively) than placebo (1.3/100 patient-years), but only 0.1%, 0.1%, and <0.1% in the placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg groups, respectively, had genital infections that required or prolonged hospitalization. The incidence of AEs consistent with volume depletion was similar with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg (1.6, 1.5, and 1.3/100 patient-years, respectively) and was higher with empagliflozin 25 mg than placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg in patients aged >75 years (4.4 vs 2.3 and 2.5/100 patient-years, respectively). The incidences of bone fractures, malignancies, decreased renal function, hepatic injury, venous thromboembolic events, and diabetic ketoacidosis were low and similar across the treatment groups. In this predefined analysis that was based on >9000 patient-years' exposure to empagliflozin, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg were well tolerated in patients with T2DM."

207,27085585,2015,Journal of clinical pharmacology,Canagliflozin use in patients with renal impairment-Utility of quantitative clinical pharmacology analyses in dose optimization.,"Canagliflozin (INVOKANA™) is approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Canagliflozin inhibits renal sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), thereby, reducing reabsorption of filtered glucose and increasing urinary glucose excretion. Given the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, we assessed the interplay between renal function, efficacy (HbA1c reduction), and safety (renal adverse reactions). The focus of this article is to highlight the FDA's quantitative clinical pharmacology analyses that were conducted to support the regulatory decision on dosing in patients with renal impairment (RI). The metrics for assessment of efficacy for T2DM drugs is standard; however, there is no standard method for evaluation of renal effects for diabetes drugs. Therefore, several analyses were conducted to assess the impact of canagliflozin on renal function (as measured by eGFR) based on available data. These analyses provided support for approval of canagliflozin in T2DM patients with baseline eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) , highlighting a data-driven approach to dose optimization. The availability of a relatively rich safety dataset (ie, frequent and early measurements of laboratory markers) in the canagliflozin clinical development program enabled adequate assessment of benefit-risk balance in various patient subgroups based on renal function.

While all the SGLT-2Is inhibit glucose reabsorption by blocking SGLT-2 receptor in kidney, dose-dependently, the highest licensed dose of canagliflozin 300-mg has an additional ability to inhibit SGLT-1 receptor in intestine transiently, that may lead to additional inhibition of prandial glucose absorption, unlike other approved highly selective SGLT-2Is. Areas covered: An electronic search on studies with highest licensed dose of all approved SGLT-2Is and long-acting GLP-1RAs was made up to December 2016. We systemically reviewed the studies of canagliflozin 300-mg and compared its glucose, body weight and SBP lowering with other approved SGLT-2Is and GLP-1RAs in their highest approved doses. Expert commentary: From the available evidences, it appears that canagliflozin 300-mg may have the highest potential to improve gluco-metabolic profile in T2DM, amongst the SGLT-2Is class. While the highest approved dosage of GLP-1RAs lowered HbA1c better than canagliflozin 300-mg, weight and SBP lowering could be non-inferior or slightly better with the latter drug. Nonetheless, only head-to-head trial can conclusively answer these questions."

However, it remains unclear whether switching DPP-4 inhibitors to tofogliflozin, a selective inhibitor of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) improves arterial stiffness in T2DM patients. Nineteen T2DM patients who had received DPP-4 inhibitors for at least 1 year were enrolled in this study. Clinical parameters and arterial stiffness evaluated by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) were measured at baseline and after 6-months treatment with tofogliflozin. At 6 months after switching to tofogliflozin, CAVI, waist circumference, body weight, body mass index, subcutaneous and visceral fat volume, white blood cell number, fasting plasma insulin, uric acid, aspartate transaminase (AST), γ-glutamyl transferase (GTP), and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were significantly reduced, while red blood cell number, haemoglobin, and HbA1c values were increased. When stratified by median values of change in CAVI after switching to tofogliflozin (ΔCAVI), baseline serum levels of AGEs were significantly higher in the low ΔCAVI group (high responder) than in the high one (low responder). ΔAST and ΔGTP were positively correlated with ΔCAVI. The present study suggests that switching DPP-4 inhibitors to tofogliflozin ameliorates arterial stiffness in T2DM patients partly via improvement of liver function. Baseline serum levels of AGEs may identify patients who improve arterial stiffness more after treatment with tofogliflozin."
210,28393583,2019,Drugs,Sotagliflozin: First Global Approval.,"Sotagliflozin (Zynquista™) is a dual inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLT) 1 and 2 being developed by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi as a treatment for type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The drug has a dual action, blunting and delaying absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract and the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule of the kidney, respectively. In the phase III inTandem clinical trial program in patients with T1DM, sotagliflozin as an adjunct to optimised insulin therapy produced a clinically meaningful reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, but was associated with a higher incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis than placebo. Sotagliflozin was recently approved for use as an adjunct to insulin in T1DM in the EU. However, the FDA Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee was divided, citing concerns regarding diabetic ketoacidosis, leading the FDA to issue an Complete Response Letter for this indication in the USA. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of sotagliflozin leading to this first approval in the EU as an adjunct to insulin in patients with T1DM with a body mass index ≥ 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who have failed to achieve adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy."
211,29766812,2017,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,"Mechanism-Based Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Modeling of Luseogliflozin, a Sodium Glucose Co-transporter 2 Inhibitor, in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.","Luseogliflozin is a selective sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that reduces hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by promoting urinary glucose excretion (UGE). A clinical pharmacology study conducted in Japanese patients with T2DM confirmed dose-dependency of UGE with once-daily administration of luseogliflozin; however, the reason for sustained UGE after plasma luseogliflozin decreased was unclear. To elucidate the effect of inhibition rate constants, K<sub>on</sub> and K<sub>off</sub>, and to explain the sustained UGE, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model was built based on the mechanisms of glucose filtration in the glomerulus and reabsorption in the renal proximal tubule of kidney as well as the kinetics of competitive inhibition of SGLT1/2 and inhibition rate constants of SGLT2, by using UGE and plasma glucose levels and luseogliflozin concentrations. This acquired population PK-PD model adequately described the sustained UGE and the estimated population means of the inhibition constant for SGLT2 (K<sub>i2</sub>) and inhibition-rate constants for SGLT2 (K<sub>on</sub> and K<sub>off</sub>) were 0.31- and 3.6-fold lower or higher than the in vitro values. Because the dissociation half-time of luseogliflozin from SGLT2 calculated from K<sub>off</sub>, 6.81 h, was consistent with the value in vitro, we considered that the sustained UGE could be explained by the long dissociation half-time. Moreover, by calculating the SGLT2 inhibition ratio using the model, we discuss other properties of the UGE time course after luseogliflozin administration."
212,31172412,2019,Canadian journal of diabetes,CANadian CAnagliflozin REgistry: Patient-Reported Outcomes of Canagliflozin in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Canadian Clinical Practice.,"To describe patient-reported outcomes (PROs) after initiation of treatment with canagliflozin (CANA) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a real-world Canadian setting. CANadian CAnagliflozin REgistry (CanCARE) is a prospective, observational, single-arm, real-world Canadian study of the effectiveness and safety of CANA for the treatment of T2DM in 527 subjects. PRO measures were collected in CanCARE using the Current Health Satisfaction Questionnaire (CHES-Q) at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months of CANA treatment to examine patient satisfaction regarding weight and overall health. Associations between changes in satisfaction with weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels were also investigated. Proportion of patients satisfied with their body weight and overall health increased from 22.1% and 26.9% at baseline to 32.4% and 49.2% after 12 months of CANA treatment, respectively. Satisfaction rates also increased on CHES-Q domains representing physical and emotional health. Correlations were found between improvement in satisfaction with body weight and weight loss (r=-0.29; p<0.01) and between improvements in satisfaction with overall health and weight loss (r=-0.13; p=0.03) and SBP (r=-0.17; p<0.01), but not with changes in A1C level. Treatment with CANA is associated with improvements in satisfaction with body weight and overall health, which may be important drivers of patient self-management and hold the potential to positively influence long-term outcomes in T2DM."
213,28769002,2019,Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy,Actionable Real-World Evidence to Improve Health Outcomes and Reduce Medical Spending Among Risk-Stratified Patients with Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic condition with a high economic burden as well as drug treatments that have not all demonstrated effects on longevity. Managed care organizations want to improve health outcomes in these complex patients but lack actionable evidence to make informed decisions on which therapies are most effective among their members and may also control total health care spending. To produce actionable evidence by identifying antidiabetic treatments that are effective and may reduce total cost of care in various risk groups of patients with T2DM, using insurance claims data that includes medical claims and pharmacy dispensing data among members of Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey with T2DM. We identified patients with T2DM in longitudinal claims data from Horizon between 2014 and 2017 with demographic and enrollment information, inpatient and outpatient diagnoses and procedures, and pharmacy dispensing. Outcomes included myocardial infarction, heart failure (HF), stroke, percutaneous revascularization, health care services utilization, and plan costs (i.e., medical, pharmacy, and total cost of care). After propensity score decile adjustment on over 20 covariates, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety of second-line antidiabetic treatment that included sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, sulfonylureas (SUs), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Among 115,308 members with T2DM, the most common comorbidities were cardiovascular risk factors, including hyperlipidemia (56%), hypertension (50%), and existing cardiovascular disease (CVD; 55%). Among members receiving dual antidiabetic treatment (n = 20,204), the most prevalent treatments were metformin plus the following second-line medications: SUs (42%), DPP-4 inhibitors (29%), SGLT-2 inhibitors (10%), or GLP-1 receptor agonists (3%). Approximately 20% of members accounted for 79% of total cost of care, with an average of $9,605 per member per year (PMPY). Compared with SU initiation and after propensity score decile adjustment, new users of SGLT-2 inhibitors had a reduced risk for HF hospitalization (HR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.13-0.89), hypoglycemia, albuminuria, microvascular disease, and metabolic failure. Among SGLT-2 inhibitor initiators with established CVD, the savings in total cost of care compared with SU initiators was $5,520 per member over an average treatment duration of 6 months and an approximate savings of $11,000 PMPY if patients persisted on treatment for 12 months. In the Horizon membership, we confirmed that SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce HF hospitalizations, resulting in reduced medical spending and savings in total cost of care. Regulatory-grade analytics of local data provided the confidence to encourage increased SGLT-2 inhibitor use to produce better outcomes and save total cost of care despite higher pharmacy spending.

215,31778623,2015,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,Empagliflozin and linagliptin combination therapy for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) fail to achieve the desired A1c goal because the antidiabetic medications used do not correct the underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities and monotherapy is not sufficiently potent to reduce the A1c to the 6.5 - 7.0% range. Insulin resistance and islet (beta and alpha) cell dysfunction are major pathophysiologic abnormalities in T2DM. We examine combination therapy with linagliptin plus empagliflozin as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of inadequately controlled T2DM patients. A literature search of all human diabetes, metabolism and general medicine journals from year 2000 to the present was conducted. Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) deficiency/resistance contributes to islet cell dysfunction by impairing insulin secretion and increasing glucagon secretion. DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) improve pancreatic islet function by augmenting glucose-dependent insulin secretion and decreasing elevated plasma glucagon levels. Linagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, reduces HbA1c, is weight neutral, has an excellent safety profile and a low risk of hypoglycemia. The expression of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) in the proximal renal tubule is upregulated in T2DM, causing excess reabsorption of filtered glucose. The SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), empagliflozin, improves HbA1c by causing glucosuria and ameliorating glucotoxicity. It also decreases weight and blood pressure, and has a low risk of hypoglycemia. The once daily oral combination of linagliptin plus empagliflozin does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia and tolerability and discontinuation rates are similar to those with each as monotherapy. At HbA1c values below 8.5% linagliptin/empagliflozin treatment produces an additive effect, whereas above 8.5%, there is a less than additive reduction with combination therapy compared with the effect of each agent alone. Linagliptin/empagliflozin addition is a logical combination in patients with T2DM, especially those with an HbA1c < 8.5%."
216,30776804,2015,Advances in therapy,Overview of Data Concerning the Safe Use of Antihyperglycemic Medications in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease.,"It can be a challenge to manage glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), due to both patient and medication issues. Although most antihyperglycemic medications can be used in mild kidney disease, many medications are either not advised or require dose adjustments in more advanced CKD. This review summarizes product label information, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies, and clinical guidelines relevant to use of antihyperglycemic medications in CKD. Product labels and guidelines from North America and Europe, as well as pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of diabetes medication use in CKD were identified through Medline and PubMed searches, up to February 2015. Available data are summarized and correlations between treatment recommendations and available research are discussed, as are glycemic targets for patients with CKD. Newer medications have significantly more data available than older medications regarding use in CKD, although larger clinical studies are still lacking for some drugs. As CKD advances, dose adjustment is needed for many medications [numerous dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, some insulins, sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors], although not for others (thiazolidinediones, meglitinides). Some medications are not recommended for use in more advanced CKD (metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, some glucagon-like protein-1 receptor agonists) for safety or efficacy reasons. There is not always good alignment between label recommendations, pharmacokinetic or clinical studies, and guideline recommendations for use of these drugs in CKD. In particular, controversy remains about the use of metformin in moderate CKD and appropriate use of liraglutide and sulfonylureas in advanced CKD. Considerable variability exists with respect to recommendations and clinical data for the many antihyperglycemic drugs used in patients with T2DM and CKD. Eli Lilly and Company."
217,28222460,2017,Current medical research and opinion,Longer-term safety and tolerability of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes: a pooled analysis.,"To evaluate the longer-term safety of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The safety/tolerability of canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg were assessed using data pooled from seven placebo- and active-controlled studies of 52-104 weeks in duration that enrolled a broad range of patients with T2DM (N = 5598). Canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg as monotherapy or in combination with various background antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs) were compared with pooled non-canagliflozin treatments (i.e. placebo, sitagliptin, glimepiride). Safety was assessed based on adverse event (AE) reports, including the incidence of AEs related to the mechanism of SGLT2 inhibition. Overall AE incidence was similar with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and non-canagliflozin (73.7%, 74.5%, and 73.7%). The incidence of AE-related discontinuations and serious AEs was low and balanced across groups. The incidence of male and female genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, and AEs related to osmotic diuresis or volume depletion was higher with canagliflozin versus non-canagliflozin; these AEs generally occurred early with decreased incidence over time and incidence was similar across baseline HbA1c subgroups. The incidence of fractures and diabetic ketoacidosis was low and similar across groups. Canagliflozin was associated with a low incidence of hypoglycemia when used with background AHAs that are not associated with hypoglycemia; the incidence was higher among patients on background AHAs associated with hypoglycemia (i.e. insulin, sulfonylurea, glinide). Limitations of this analysis include its post hoc nature. While this analysis included a broad population of patients, including those with a history or risk of cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, the longer-term safety in these patient populations was not specifically evaluated. Ongoing outcome studies will provide data on the long-term safety of canagliflozin in these populations. Longer-term exposure to canagliflozin as monotherapy or in combination with other agents was generally well tolerated in patients with T2DM.

218,26583910,2017,The American journal of medicine,EMPA-REG OUTCOME: The Endocrinologist's Point of View.,"For many years, it was widely accepted that control of plasma lipids and blood pressure could lower macrovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), whereas the benefits of lowering plasma glucose were largely limited to improvements in microvascular complications. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study demonstrated for the first time that a glucose-lowering agent, the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin, could reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and overall mortality when given in addition to standard care in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk. These results were entirely unexpected and have led to much speculation regarding the potential mechanisms underlying cardiovascular benefits. In this review, the results of EMPA-REG OUTCOME are summarized and put into perspective for the endocrinologist who is treating patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease."
219,26581749,2016,Clinical therapeutics,EMPA-REG and Other Cardiovascular Outcome Trials of Glucose-lowering Agents: Implications for Future Treatment Strategies in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"During the last decade, the armamentarium for glucose-lowering drugs has increased enormously by the development of DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors, allowing individualization of antidiabetic therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Some combinations can now be used without an increased risk for severe hypoglycemia and weight gain. Following a request of the US Food and Drug Administration, many large cardiovascular (CV) outcome studies have been performed in patients with longstanding disease and established CV disease. In the majority of CV outcome studies, CV risk factors were well controlled and a high number of patients were already treated with ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, statins and antiplatelet drugs. Most studies with insulin glargine and newer glucose-lowering drugs (saxagliptin, alogliptin, sitagliptin, lixisenatide) demonstrated safety of newer glucose-lowering agents but did not show superiority in the CV outcomes compared with placebo. By contrast, in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) study, CV death, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure were significantly decreased when empagliflozin was added instead of placebo to therapy for patients with high CV risk and T2DM already well treated with statins, glucose-lowering drugs, and blood pressure-lowering drugs as well as antiplatelet agents. In addition, renal endpoints including endstage renal disease were also significantly reduced when empagliflozin was added instead of placebo. Interestingly, the reduction of these clinically relevant end points was observed after a few months, making antiatherogenic effects an unlikely cause. The fact that the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke were not reduced is in line with the hypothesis that hemodynamic factors in particular have contributed to the impressive improvement of the prognosis. To reduce the CV burden of patients with T2DM, drugs influencing factors involved in atherogenesis (eg, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, increase of HDL, prothrombotic state) are more promising. The recent IRIS (Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke) study documented a significant reduction in stroke and MI when pioglitazone instead of placebo was given to nondiabetic patients presenting with both stroke/transient ischemic attack and insulin resistance, confirming results from the PROactive (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events) study in patients with T2DM. Based on these new data, we suggest that the addition of both empagliflozin and pioglitazone to metformin might be the relative best option to reduce the high CV morbidity and mortality of patients with T2DM and already established CV complications. The very recent announcement that the CV outcome study with liraglutide (LEADER) also demonstrated a significant reduction of the composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) gives new hope for further beneficial treatment options for T2DM patients with established CVD."
220,27977934,2016,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Long-term maintenance of efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.,"To evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin versus placebo added to usual care in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Data were pooled from two phase III studies (NCT01031680 and NCT01042977) in high-risk patients (N = 1887) with T2DM and CVD treated with dapagliflozin (10 mg/day) or placebo. Patients completing the double-blind treatment studies (24 weeks) entered one or two sequential double-blind, long-term (LT) extensions of 28 (LT1; n = 1649) and 52 (LT2; n = 568) weeks. Baseline and CVD characteristics were similar in the two groups. Patients entering LT1 and LT2 on dapagliflozin maintained a greater mean reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) versus placebo at 52 weeks [LT1, -0.58% (95% confidence interval -0.68, -0.49)] and 104 weeks [LT2, -0.35% (95% confidence interval -0.59, -0.12)]. Mean body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) reductions versus placebo were maintained in patients entering LT1 (52 weeks; -2.23 kg and -3.25 mmHg, respectively) and LT2 (104 weeks; -3.16 kg and -2.03 mmHg, respectively). Patients on dapagliflozin had a better three-item composite endpoint of clinical benefit (glycaemia, weight and SBP) compared with placebo at week 24 (LT1, 10.1% vs. 1.1%) and week 104 (LT2, 6.7% vs. 1.4%). Genital and urinary tract infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin than with placebo. Events of hypoglycaemia, renal impairment/failure and volume depletion were similar between groups. The long-term efficacy of dapagliflozin to maintain reductions in HbA1c, SBP and body weight over 2 years, together with its tolerability profile, make dapagliflozin an appropriate option in high-risk patients with T2DM and CVD."

Japanese patients (≥65 years old) who were first prescribed ipragliflozin within 3 months after its launch in April 2014 were registered in this post-marketing surveillance (PMS). Final data collection was in July 2015. Survey items included demographics, treatments, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), vital signs, and laboratory variables. The PMS included 8505 patients (4181 males/4324 females). The mean age and diabetes duration were 72.3 years and 10.6 years, respectively. In 84.3% of patients, ipragliflozin was prescribed at 50 mg/day, which was continued unchanged. Overall, 16.91% of patients experienced 1880 ADRs, and 165 ADRs were classified as serious in 127 patients (1.49%). ADRs of special interest included skin complications, volume depletion, polyuria/pollakiuria, genital infection, urinary tract infection, renal disorders, hypoglycemia, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, malignant tumor, fracture, and ketone body-related events. This 1-year PMS revealed probable ADRs in elderly Japanese patients with T2DM prescribed ipragliflozin in real-world settings, with no new safety concerns. The risk factors for ADRs varied but could be rationalized. The results should help physicians to identify possible treatment-emergent ADRs in ipragliflozin-treated patients."

Dapagliflozin improves glycemic control and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in T2DM patients. This double-blind phase III study evaluated the effects of dapagliflozin on glycemic control and blood pressure in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM and hypertension, despite ongoing therapy with a renin-angiotensin system blocker. Patients were randomized to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg (n = 302) or placebo (n = 311) once daily for 12 weeks. Endpoints were change from baseline to week 12 in seated SBP and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c); longitudinal repeated-measures analysis was performed. Additional endpoints included other hemodynamic measures, serum uric acid, fasting plasma glucose, body weight, blood lipids and heart rate. After 12 weeks, dapagliflozin-treated versus placebo-treated patients showed significant reductions in HbA1c (-0.6% vs -0.1%, p < 0.0001), mean seated SBP (-10.4 vs -7.3 mmHg, p = 0.0010) and mean 24 h ambulatory SBP (-9.6 vs -6.7 mmHg, p = 0.0043). Dapagliflozin also reduced body weight compared with placebo (-1.0 vs -0.3 kg). Dapagliflozin was well tolerated, with adverse events consistent with previous studies. Dapagliflozin improved glycemic control, and reduced SBP as well as body weight in patients with poorly controlled T2DM and hypertension."
223,27009868,2018,Clinical drug investigation,Cost-Effectiveness of Empagliflozin for the Treatment of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus at Increased Cardiovascular Risk in Greece.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is frequently associated with co-morbidities that exacerbate cardiovascular (CV) risk. CV disease is the leading cause of death in people with diabetes across the world and accounts for approximately half the deaths in the T2DM population. Hence, the objective of present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin, in addition to standard of care (SoC), for the treatment of adult patients with T2DM and high CV risk in Greece. A health economic model was used to project clinical and economic outcomes of patients receiving empagliflozin plus SoC compared with those receiving SoC alone over a lifetime horizon. CV and renal event rates were derived from patient level data from the EMPA-REG-OUTCOME<sup>®</sup> trial by fitting time-dependent parametric survival functions. 5000 individual patient profiles randomly sampled from the trial were simulated using a time-to-event approach. Model extrapolated outcomes included life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Following a Greek third-party payer perspective, only direct medical costs related to drug acquisition as well as fatal and non-fatal diabetes-related complications were considered (€2016). Cost units and utility data were extracted from the literature and publicly available official sources. Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of changes in input data. Over a patient's lifetime, empagliflozin was predicted to result in longer mean survival (14.01 LY vs. 11.87 LY with SoC) and reduced rate of clinical events accumulating 7.75 QALYs versus 6.83 QALYs on SoC alone at additional costs of €4235. The generated ICER of empagliflozin was €4633 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis confirmed empagliflozin's cost-effective profile. At the defined willingness-to-pay threshold of €34,000 per QALY gained, probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that empagliflozin was estimated to have a 100% probability of being cost-effective relative to SoC. Empagliflozin added to SoC was estimated to be a highly cost-effective treatment option for the treatment of T2DM in adults with increased CV disease risk in Greece."

In a post-hoc analysis, we assessed the effect of empagliflozin on SBP and DBP using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring in patients categorized as dippers (sleep-time mean SBP ≤ 90% of awake-time mean; n = 417) or non-dippers (sleep-time mean SBP > 90% of awake-time mean; n = 350). In dippers, adjusted mean (SE) changes from baseline in mean 24-hour SBP (mm Hg) at week 12 were -0.2 (0.7) with placebo vs -3.8 (0.6) and -3.9 (0.7) with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively (both P  < .001 vs placebo). In non-dippers, these changes were 1.0 (0.7) with placebo vs -1.6 (0.7) with empagliflozin 10 mg ( P  = .013 vs placebo) and -3.8 (0.7) with empagliflozin 25 mg ( P  < .001 vs placebo). In both dippers and non-dippers, SBP and DBP patterns over 24 hours were maintained. There were no clinically relevant changes in heart rate with empagliflozin. In conclusion, empagliflozin significantly reduced mean 24-hour SBP compared with placebo in dippers and non-dippers."

STELLA-LONG TERM is an ongoing 3-year prospective surveillance study of Japanese T2DM patients receiving ipragliflozin 50 mg once daily. In this subgroup analysis, patient characteristics, laboratory variables, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were compared between non-elderly (<65 years) and elderly (≥65 years) patients. Non-elderly patients had significantly higher body mass index and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than elderly patients (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <8.0% was significantly higher among elderly patients (P < 0.001). HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and body weight significantly decreased from baseline to 3 and 12 months in both groups (all P < 0.05 vs. baseline). The ADR incidence was 10.83% vs. 10.42% in non-elderly and elderly patients. The incidence of skin complications was 0.98% vs. 1.65% and that of renal disorder was 0.47% vs. 0.95% in non-elderly and elderly patients (both P = 0.003). Ipragliflozin was effective in non-elderly and elderly Japanese T2DM patients in a real-world clinical setting. The incidence of renal disorder and skin complications was significantly higher in elderly vs. non-elderly patients."

To establish whether these benefits can be replicated in a real-world setting, should be expected with the use of dapagliflozin, and apply to T2DM patients at low risk of CVD. General practice, population-based, retrospective cohort study (January 2013 to September 2015). The Health Improvement Network database. A total of 22,124 T2DM patients (4444 exposed to dapagliflozin; 17,680 unexposed T2DM patients) matched for age, sex, body mass index, T2DM duration, and smoking. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality (high and low risk for CVD) in the total study population, expressed as the adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). As a secondary analysis in the low-risk population, all-cause mortality and incident CVD were considered. Patients with T2DM exposed to dapagliflozin were significantly less likely to die of any cause (aIRR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.75; P = 0.001). Similarly, in low-risk patients, death from any cause was significantly lower in the cohort exposed to dapagliflozin (aIRR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.78; P = 0.002). The difference in the risk of incident CVD did not reach statistical significance between groups in low-risk patients (aIRR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.31; P = 0.546). Patients with T2DM who were exposed to dapagliflozin had a lower risk of death from any cause irrespective of baseline CVD status."
227,28387058,2016,Clinical pharmacokinetics,Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Canagliflozin in Healthy Volunteers and Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Canagliflozin is an orally active, reversible, selective sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor. A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model of canagliflozin, including relevant covariates as sources of inter-individual variability, was developed to describe phase I, II, and III data in healthy volunteers and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The final analysis included 9061 pharmacokinetic (PK) samples from 1616 volunteers enrolled in nine phase I, two phase II, and three phase III studies and was performed using NONMEM(®) 7.1. Inter-individual variability was evaluated using an exponential model and the residual error model was additive in the log domain. The first-order conditional estimation method with interaction was applied and the model was parameterized in terms of rate constants. Covariate effects were explored graphically on empirical Bayes estimates of PK parameters, as shrinkage was low. Clinical relevance of statistically significant covariates was evaluated. The predictive properties of the model were illustrated by prediction-corrected visual predictive checks. A two-compartment PK model with lag-time and sequential zero- and first-order absorption and first-order elimination best described the observed data. Sex, age, and weight on apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment, body mass index on first-order absorption rate constant, and body mass index and over-encapsulation on lag-time, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, by MDRD equation), dose, and genetic polymorphism (carriers of UGT1A9*3 allele) on elimination rate constant were identified as statistically significant covariates. The prediction-corrected visual predictive checks revealed acceptable predictive performance of the model. The popPK model adequately described canagliflozin PK in healthy volunteers and in patients with T2DM. Because of the small magnitude of statistically significant covariates, they were not considered clinically relevant. However, dosage adjustments are recommended for T2DM patients with renal impairment (eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2): 100 or 300 mg/day; eGFR of 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2): 100 mg/day)."
